Overall good job, I can see the effort in ensuring good naming for variable and methods.

However, there is space for improvement in ensuring the package imports are correctly formatted using CheckStyle, which includes ordering and spacing.

Some of your methods are very long and complex to understand. Consider simplifying them.

There should be an empty line between description and parameter section for your Javadocs.

Also, do ensure that your files end with a newline.

Packaging can be improved. `seedu` is the default package name given from the template, but you do not need to follow it. You may want to organise your Java classes into the correct folder and package them accordingly.

Overall great work! I think there are very small coding standard nits that have been pointed out. I would also like to point out that perhaps it is better if you had a separation of concerns with the `TaskList` and the printing of each action. Since you already have a set of `Command` classes, it might be better to explore moving the printing behavior to each `Command` subclass so that the `TaskList` can focus on just manipulating the `List&gt;Task>`! Just a food for thought! Great job otherwise, keep it up!

In some of the Javadocs for params, sometimes they start with a capital letter while other times a lowercase letter. Eg "the" and "The". Maybe it's worth making consistent?

For reference, the coding standard's example starts with a lowercase letter unless the word is something like a class name.

The readibility is solid! However, it was hard to keep track of the logical flow of the program. I think separating the commands into different classes to handle behavior for each command, and handling storage as part of duke instead of parser would be the logical next step!

LGTM! Some suggestions are your UI class could be used to handle more user interactions and just some small nits on the line break before an operator.

Overall, you have done an excellent job and is on par with code qualities and standard. Very intuitive naming for methods and variables. Keep it up! 🎉

LGTM. Some suggestions are that you could put everything inside a package, and reduce the usage of '*' in imports. 

Other than those you are on par with the coding standard, good naming, layout, statements and comments. You’re doing an excellent job, keep it up! :tada:

Don't really see the purpose of creating exception classes which extend Duke Exception (There could be a lot of edge cases, and it isn't viable to create one for every case). Instead, you can just throw a new Duke Exception with the required message and action.

For example:
```java
if (!event.equals("todo")) {
    throw new DukeException("Invalid todo event");
}
```

I like the logic in this file.
It is very smooth and flows nicely.
Each method is short and concise except for that 'parser' you have within the constructor.
What I can think of is putting it in another class just to parse the data you load from the file, but that may be too much work.
The next is that I strongly believe that if you change Ui to have static methods, you would not have to deal with needing to place it in the arguments.

No major problems, just come code style changes needed.
All of your code is very easy to read. 
I like the flow of logic and they way you name things. 
The all the names became more intuitive as I read more of your code.
However, if I'm just reading clips of your code, the names would not give me much context.

The code is modular with clear separations of concerns, helps with code design and maintainability in the future. Naming conventions are largely consistent and clear. Error handling is also done well. Appropriate javadocs also observed to help understand the code.

parseCommand could be refactored to be smaller methods as it is extremely lengthy.

LGTM overall!

The code has repeated checks for details length and emptiness. Consider creating a helper method to standardize these checks.
```java
private static void validateInputDetails(String[] details) throws DukeException {
    if (details.length < 2 || details[1].trim().isEmpty()) {
        throw new DukeException("Invalid command! Please provide more details");

Your commitment to code quality shines through in this PR. It's evident that you've paid meticulous attention to detail, adhering to consistent naming conventions and maintaining a clean and readable codebase. Your choice of well-descriptive variable names significantly enhances code clarity. Kudos on your dedication to producing high-quality code!

However, one suggestion for further improvement is to consider importing specific files instead of using the "*" notation. While it's convenient, explicit imports can enhance code transparency and help prevent potential naming conflicts in the future. Keep up the good work!

The current coding style is as such:

Perhaps you may want to maintain consistency of method names using verbs and avoid gerunds (verb + ing)

So in this case, `list(TaskList tasks)` may be better than `listing(TaskList tasks)`. An alternative name could be `listAllTasks(TaskList tasks)` to make it more descriptive and easier to read.

Overall good job in terms of implementation! Be careful on the small details that causes coding violations.

Also, I believe JavaDocs should start with verb-s words. (For example: `Returns`, `Creates`, `Prints`, `Converts`, and so on.)

There are also some minor issues in consistency with naming of methods.

Generally very well done and I had to nitpick to find any points of improvement at all with regards to coding standard. Only improvements I can find are the casing for static variables and potentially being able to use more static variables for the strings instead since putting the full string in another method may make it difficult to read.

Code so good it makes me feel out of my depth. I do have some comments on naming but will leave it for the other PR reviewer.

I like your naming choice for the `handle` methods in this `Command` class, so they sound like actions.

Since `Command` appears to be a [utility class](https://www.baeldung.com/java-helper-vs-utility-classes), how about making its methods `static` instead and removing the need for a constructor (making it `private Command() { ... }`)?

It's not immediately clear what the format is from this alone and what the code is trying to parse. How about adding a high level description of what's going on?

For example, you may minimally link the docs to `Task#toSaveString`, so it is clear that `parseTask` intends to parse a format that's output by said method.

I notice that your `toSaveString` implementations do not sanitise user inputs. Hence, user data may be corrupted if a user inputs the `|` character in their task description. You might need to escape or prevent inputs with said character to fix this.

As per our standards, JavaDoc descriptions should [follow the form provided here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#comments). Notably, it should only have `/**` at the start, have a line break between description and parameters, and should have punctuation.

For `if` blocks that you want to add comments on, perhaps consider moving the comment to within the code block? That way, your code follows Egyptian-style brackets.

```suggestion
        } else if (input.equals("list")) {
            //list out each task from Duke.tasks ArrayList
```

This applies to other similar sections as well.

Additionally, with this many cases, perhaps you might want to consider using `switch`-`case`? IDEs are likely to also be able to auto-convert them for you.

I also noticed that these formatting issues show up in other areas as well, so do update them appropriately. To save time, you might want to use `codestyle` to automatically detect them, and configure your IDE to automatically format them as well.

This doesn't check if the input is either `mark` or `unmark`. If a user inputs `markzzzzzz`, this will still be treated as `unmark` even though it is an invalid command, because the input still contains the substring `mark`. To avoid similar problems like this, perhaps you should use Java Enums to ensure input validity.

Good job! Overall logic of the code LGTM and I really love the error messages you show to the user. Just a few overall suggestions and tips to follow coding standards:

1. For some reason, your `main/java/tasks` folder is missing in this repository. I think they haven't been committed yet so you can try to find them and commit them as needed. It's a bit weird to see test cases for `test/java/tasks` when the actual code isn't even present :thinking:
2. Don't forget to leave a blank line above method definitions like `public static void main(String[] args)` for all methods to improve readability of the code.
3. Don't forget to move the files in the `main/java` folder into `main/java/duke` and include these files in a package. According to coding standards, **all** files should be put in a package, even the main `Duke.java`.
4. If you have time, can try to add JavaDoc onto `Duke.java` and files without JavaDoc but I don't think it's a requirement in `A-JavaDoc` to include JavaDoc onto everything?

Probably unintended but I think you intend for this to be `public`? It's mostly for code consistency (interface methods are by default `public abstract`)

woah this code is quite trippy to read. Probably can split into different expressions to ease readability:

```java
String eventDescription = taskArr[0].strip();
LocalDateTime fromDate = parseDateTimeFromString(taskArr[1].strip());
LocalDateTime toDate = parseDateTimeFromString(taskArr[2].strip());

tasks.addTask(new Event(eventDescription, false, fromDate, toDate));

Nit: As`split[0]` is used across multiple statements, you can assign it to a noun before using it, perhaps `String potentialCommand = split[0];`.

I also think that the naming of variables `splits1` and `splits2` can be more descriptive, perhaps `firstSubstring` and `secondSubstring`.

similar to the above comment for the try-catch block format and after thinking through, I think maybe you can consider moving taskArrayList = new ArrayList&gt;>() before the if block just to make it cleaner! It's perfectly fine right now though.

I think since this count variable is now only called by the setTasks method, you can reduce the scope to follow coding standards (by initializing it inside the method itself)

Code quality is generally fine. The only significant issue is with the echo method in Parser.java, which was mentioned in the comments along with a few more trivial problems. Consider creating some more methods so echo can become... shorter. Good job otherwise :)

Overall very high quality and neat code. Javadoc comments could be written for more public methods but I think it is fine even if you dont since it meets the requirements. I could not find any issues with naming or formatting so overall seems alright, can try to run the stylechecker in case I missed out on tiny issues. PS: I am reviewer 1 so I only looked for issues on code styles and standards.

Overall code is very clean and easy to read, especially with the intuitive function names e.g. showSavingError();
Good and succinct abstraction of code into different classes which helped with the clarity.
Test cases were sufficient and handled a majority of the cases.

The issues that I had was with the convoluted if-else loop which I felt could be easily replaced with a switch statement and perhaps some missing JavaDoc comments here and there.

Anyways, LGTM!

remember to close the scanner.

perhaps you can bundle the scanner as part of the Ui class for better encapsulation.

-> you can instantiate the scanner in Ui. and when you call the bye function, you can close the scanner and print the goodbye message.

The code is clean and the majority follows the Java coding standard. There are only a few violations that I've marked out.

Since this is a boolean method, is it better if you prefix it with keywords like `has`? Maybe something like `hasTasksWithKeyword`? Though I know that the string method `contains` also returns a boolean value, so its definitely up to you!

I've pointed out some minor modifications which are not serious offences of the standard. It is up to you to change it or keep it!

It is better to split this method into multiple methods, because this method not only get user input, but also display the message. My suggestion is the display message can be done in another method, an example shows below

```ruby
public void printAddTaskMessage(Task task, TaskList taskList) {
        System.out.println("Got it, I've added this task:\n    "  +
                task.toString() + "\n" +
                "Now you have " + taskList.size() + " tasks in the list.");

I think there is no indentation for case clauses and no need curly braces, example as below 😃 
```
switch (condition) {
case ABC:
    statements;
    // Fallthrough
case DEF:
    statements;
    break;
case XYZ:
    statements;
    break;
default:
    statements;
    break;
}
```

Overall, I found the code very readable. There was a lot of effort that went in as there were many classes being made and used appropriately. I found the code has an extensible design as the different subclasses of Command can be modified easily to accommodate more changes in future. The fields were also set to final to prevent accidental modifications in future.

Though I can grasp what this code is doing 👍 , I feel that it might be better if you abstract this portion out. eg. Create a new method,

I like the way you encapsulate the commands within their own respective classes. 
However, I feel that this switch block should belong in the Parser class since a Parser decides what to do with the given input. In this case, Arona class seems to be the one deciding what to do based on the user input.

Overall, good effort in following the guidelines, aside from a couple of mistakes that are prevalent throughout the code. Whitespace is missing from many of the places where they are needed (if-else, try-catch, operators, commas etc) and quite a few other coding standard violations are present too. Once you pick a few of those nits, and change some of the names to be more descriptive and fitting, the code should be good to go!

Overall, I like how you structure your code. It's easy to understand and clean. One thing that you might want to consider is dividing the classes into packages instead of all being in the Iris package, that way when the code base is starting to get bigger, it's easier for you to keep track of the files and move from one file to another.

Line 84 here is probably unnecessary. You can declare a new line using the \n character as follows:

Overall your code is quite well organised when it comes to classes. There were barely any coding standard violations. One general suggestion is to group classes into multiple packages, just to make it easier to find a specific class.

eg. Task, TaskList, ToDo, Event and Deadline can be under a "Task" package.

Perhaps can avoid nesting by having a variable to conditionally store different strings depending on the value of isListCommand? 🤔

Perhaps can add this as a guard clause at the start of the method? Since the function can terminate if the list is empty 🤔

    return; // terminates the method early since there is nothing to print

like the reviewer before me has mentioned, this isn't phrased as a verb :P

I'm a lot less sure of this, but:
do you think it's a good idea to make this method throw `NumberFormattingException` as well? Your code handles it properly, but I thought it might add a bit of clarity to the types of exceptions expected from this method. 
To some extent, this ambiguity is inherent for the Exception design pattern in general, though, so feel free to disagree.

While it's good that this handles its own exceptions, I do think that UI should be handled by `Ui.java` for maximal OOP-ness; while it's troublesome, I hope it's a good time to do so regardless since there's a shift to GUI anyway.

The coding standard for this course states to break before an operator. So perhaps you could put the + on the next line, rather than at the end of the previous. I think doing this would make your code more readable! (Also applies to the rest of the methods in this class)

I think you could consider defining a constant for "1", since you refer to it quite a few times in this method.
Eg "private static final String MARKED_AS_DONE = "1";", 
     then this line (and lines 97 & 103) can be rewritten as "if (input[1].equals(MARKED_AS_DONE)) {"

Maybe you can have a look at the naming convention mentioned in week 3 notes 3.7:

> Java code normally use camelCase for method names e.g., `testStringConversion` but when writing test methods, sometimes another convention is used:
> `unitBeingTested_descriptionOfTestInputs_expectedOutcome`
> e.g., `intDivision_zeroDivisor_exceptionThrown`

but I believe your naming looks good as well!

I like the clever observation that you can tell a lot of task types just from their first names, wish I had thought of that!

However, it might cause issues down the line if just strings are used and passed around. Maybe we could convert to an enum? Maybe instead of acting on the output of this string, we could have a codeblock to parse it into an enum type, similar to the one you've defined in Parser :

```java
private enum ChatFunction {
        LIST,
        MARK,
        UNMARK,
        TODO,
        DEADLINE,
        EVENT,
        DELETE,
        FIND
    }
```

And maybe a code block like so :

```
ChatFunction func;
switch (taskString) {
 
                case "T":
                    func = ChatFunction.TODO;
                    break;
```

It might help if the code needs to be refactored later on!

I think the description of this method may be misleading? From what I have read in the `ToDo`, `Deadline` and `Event` implementation of the method, it is simply returning the storage format in a `String` and not actually writing to the file?

Overall, the code is easy to read and understand and I like how you follow the coding standards, especially the clear line break and method name. However, though the review should be focusing on the coding standard (so you may ignore this part if other aspects of the code is subject to change), maybe you can consider make a general Task interface and let Todo, Deadline and Event to be three parallel child class? For me, it does not really make sense that a event is also a deadline.

Overall good job! Keep it up!

I like the naming of your methods, ensuring that it is prefixed with a verb. This is in-line with the coding standards.

@Originalidk its used on line 12 and 15 in Ui.java haha,

i.e print a horizontal line

Solid work! Keep it up :)
Perhaps you might want to consolidate all the System.out.println(...) to specific methods in the Ui file, and update the corresponding print methods in each file with the methods. This will make the code cleaner and improve clarity.

This will also make the code easier to maintain in the long run, as you only need to edit 1 file, the ui.java file, instead of going through all the files (e.g task, event, deadline etc) to update the print statements.

switch (data[0]) {
case "T":
    ToDo todo = new ToDo(data[2]);
    if (data[1].equals("1")) todo.markAsDone();
    tasks.add(todo);
    break;
case "D":
    Deadline deadline = new Deadline(data[2], data[3]);
    if (data[1].equals("1")) deadline.markAsDone();
    tasks.add(deadline);
    break;
case "E":
    String[] time = data[3].split(" ");
    Event event = new Event(data[2], time[0], time[1]);
    if (data[1].equals("1")) event.markAsDone();
    tasks.add(event);
    break;

Generally, I think there can be improvements made to code cleanliness in terms of abstracting different functionalities in the code. Furthermore, I think you may need to add javadocs more to explain your classes and methods :) Overall, I think it is interesting you incorporated a lot of other data structures into the project and explored more than what is required of the module! I wish I had as much time as you haha :D

Perhaps leaving the whitespace for the inherited classes would be clearer? One would have to be cognisant that the parent class already has a whitespace; and this isn't consistent with how other Java exceptions are implemented.

Hi! I'm assigned your repo for the 2nd PR review for iP.

I think your code is quite nicely implemented! However, I think Javadoc is mandatory for the iP and we have to be quite careful with how we name methods or risk penalization.

Hi! I was assigned to you for the peer PR review for the iP.

I really like the way you implemented and designed the bot. It was very easy to piece out and see how different parts worked together. As this round focuses on the coding standards, I think generally its good. But I do see some inconsistency with blank lines in your code.

                }
                // Rest of code...

Not that it is wrong but, is it possible to separate the print statements with the Task Classes themselves? So instead of printing here, you print in the caller function instead. It is best practice to separate the display and the data if possible. 

so for example 

Todo.java
```java 
public Todo(String description) {
    super(description);
}
```
Duke.java / wherever you create an object of this class
```
list.add(new Todo("blablabla");
System.out.println("Got it. I've added this task:");
System.out.println("  " + this);
System.out.println("Now you have " + super.size + " tasks in the list.");
```

sorry for the confusion, since splitText is a member of the class and inputString is a local variable to this function, maybe you can use this.splitText to specify that it is a member of the class because I was confused for a second thinking whether it is a local variable or not.

## Overall Review
Overall I found your code easy to read for the most part, but there are some issues I came across:
* **your code is too cramped** in some places. Adding some line breaks will improve code readability. 
* **method names are undescriptive** is another issue I see often. Using verbs to name methods would be better.

LGTM, good job :) I have added some small suggestions on areas where I think code clarity can be improved. Overall, perhaps you can consider breaking down some of the classes (for e,g. ChatEngine) for a cleaner code!

Maybe can move the '+' sign from the end of a line to the start of the next line? Also, make the split such that the two halves are not too different in length.

So can rewrite as something like this:

        + "\n Now You have " + size + " tasks in the list.";

I cannot see where this variable is used... In addition, do you think we should make this "line" consistent with the "line" you declared in the Command.java?

The `userInputArray[0].contains("find")` will return true as long as it has a substring "find" in it. In this case, "asdfacads**find**adfaefedcef" will also be considered as a valid command. Similar for the others. What do you think?

Do you think it would be more convenient for you as a developer and more robust for your programe to extract each token, separated by " " (space), first, and then process each token to decide whether it is a command, task name, integer or time? Something like that... 
I see what you are trying to do here. It is just that every time you want to add a new command, you have to modify this "if else" statement and check the length of the input and other things all over again.

Overall, great job for putting together this program! There is no major issues in my opinion, but perhaps due to some nuances of certain OOP principles, there are some methods of printing lines that I feel should be in the Ui class instead of say the TaskList class. Otherwise, well done and keep up the good work! :)

In general, good job! It was great that you considered speeding up string manipulation operations by using the StringBuilder class, and also OOP principles are generally adhered to. However, methods in the Ui class seems to be repetitive and it would be good if you can find a way to abstract these patterns to make the code leaner. Otherwise, well done! :)

Maybe each logical units within a block should be separated by one blank line?

Good job on implementation of createTask, the flow of the code makes sense (how we handle todo, then deadline and lastly event). Perhaps, the formatting of date could be handled by a separate function or class to make the code more readable!

I like how this method makes use of DukeException to inform the user that the task to be deleted does not exist. As this function deals with deletion of task, perhaps it could be a method implemented under TaskList.java.

As mentioned earlier, this makes good use of DukeException. Maybe it would be better to relate the error message to the IndexOutOfBoundsException.
```suggestion
            throw new DukeException("OOPS!! There is only " + tasks.size() + " tasks. Please input a number up till " + tasks.size() );

Good effort on implementing the test cases to test different date formats. Perhaps the test name can include something about date format (rather than dash, slash and others) to make it clear that test focuses on testing date formats.

I really like the way you structured your entire program. You used ui.readCommand to form the fullCommand string, then formed the Command using Parser.parse, and finally executed the command using command.execute, providing tasks, ui and storage as arguments.

It's great that the DeadlineCon method is relatively small. However, would you like to consider using JavaDoc to explain what the code does? Also, "DeadlineCon" is a method and should be in camel case. You may wish to rename the "Con" term to a full word.

Overall, I enjoy the abstraction that you have done to the Duke Class, especially in the Storage class, where you specifically remove particular lines depending on the command. An overall comment could be to add more Javadocs, especially for public methods as it will allow improved overall readability, specifically in the case of when u have overloaded methods, as this will allow the author and others to better understand the different scenarios for using the overloaded methods.

LGTM overall!! The naming of the methods are all of the course standard, just that it might be better for you to start adding javadoc to your public methods and also take note of the indentation of switch statements. Readability can also be improved if commands are split into different methods to handle each case (instead of putting all in one method). Good job so far! :D

Code quality is great in general. Verified with checkstyle to be aligning with the course's Java standards.

Side note, is there any reason why you chose to bundle `datetime`, `exception`, `parser`, and `ui` in a `monday` package? It seems a little unintuitive to have a nested package with the exact same name as its parent. I noticed that you had to do `import package.monday.monday.etc...` in many places, which seems a little strange. Perhaps you could rename the nested package or remove it and place the folders in the same level as the rest.

I would suggest adding checkstyle to Gradle, and using the configs in addressbook-level3: https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/config/checkstyle. This would help to catch styling issues in your code.

Also, I noticed that you have a lot of duplicate files. Perhaps you copied them by accident when trying to move them around in folders.

I think rather than adding a comment, it would be better for TaskList to generate a ArrayList of strings for the Storage class to write to file. This ensures that the the ArrayList of Tasks would not be passed to an external class. This make the Storage class more reusable as well.

Your code is clean looking and generally no naming issues as far as I can tell.

I feel that this part is nested very deeply, with try-catch blocks nested inside each other, and this makes the code hard to read. Perhaps you can make it one big try-catch block and remove the inner nested ones. You can also break down the method into a few sub methods to make it more readable.

Adding on to the previous comment, perhaps you could possibly do this since you are already using Paths:
```java
Path fullPath= Paths.get(".").resolve(inputPath);
```
`Paths.get(".")` gets the current working directory and you can add on the user input using `resolve(inputPath)`

You can take a look [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/pathOps.html#create) for Path operations :)

Based on your code in Duke.java, I thought you were planning on using the java.nio package(which from what I read, is newer and better than java.io which is what this line is using. 

I actually tried using Paths entirely initially but I couldn't find many tutorials online for nio classes so I stuck to using only java.io.File classes. 

Since you already incorporated some nio classes like Path and Files into your code maybe you can consider using those mainly instead?

You can try taking a look at [this](https://www.baeldung.com/java-how-to-create-a-file)

Overall, the code was very well done and I will not be nitpicking for mistakes. Apart from line seperations which should be kept the same throughout, your code is generally easy to read, with variables and methods being named well. Javadocs is also done well with substantial description to explain the classes and methods. The code is well-structured and avoids deep nesting, making it easier to follow and understand. Keep up the good work!

Overall, the encapsulation is impressive, and I appreciate how you've organised the classes into Java Packages. Great job! When it comes to the application's logic, I'd suggest conducting more extensive testing. For example, you can test scenarios like attempting to delete a task at index 6 from a task list containing only 2 tasks. This will help ensure the code handles such situations gracefully.

Really good job for IP. I really like how you have JavaDoc for all the functions and even between lines of code to make it easy to understand your code. 
Just a personal opinion, I would prefer to have different packages, for example:
ToDo, Deadline, Event, and Task can be under the same package together. I think this makes the code more organised.

Perhaps use plural form for variable name since it is a collection of objects (A list of tasks)? 

An example from the [SE Coding Standard Guide](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#naming) is:
```
Collection<Point> points;
```
So for your case, perhaps you can use ```List<Task> tasks```, if it makes sense.

Is the abstraction into 10 types of commands the best way?

LGTM👍 (looks GREAT to me)!
Overall, I like that the code was very OOP-ised. Excellent abstraction of methods into their relevant classes. On top of that, _phenomenal_ abstraction of exceptions and exception handling. 
If the circumstances allow it, you could try truncating the logic flow in getUserInput using the enum class, to make your code _even_ easier to read.
Great work thus far!

Would it be beneficial to handle the exception more gracefully by throwing a custom exception, like 'DukeException', or displaying a more user friendly message?

e.g.
```java
try {
    Files.createDirectories(path.getParent());
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("An I/O error occurred while creating directories: " + e.getMessage());

For `@return` tags, Javadoc is actually optional for members like `toString()` as they are pretty [self-explanatory](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7.3.1-javadoc-exception-self-explanatory), hence it is okay to give a one-line summary which in this case is:

You can consider simplfying the code by using [enums](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_enums.asp) and [switch cases](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp). This not only reduces the number of conditionals and braces for better readability, but also introduces lesser repetitive methods, such as `isDeleteCommand()`, `isFindCommand()` to maintain!

While it is a common belief that interfaces should have `-able` suffix in their names, I think it is not required to adhere this especially if it does not provide a semantic meaning. Maybe naming it into "Executable" or "CommandExecutable" makes more sense if you're sticking with this rule?

Indentation & Formatting:

The code seems to be properly indented, which makes it easier to read.
The consistent use of brackets {} and their placement adheres to the Java coding conventions.
Variable Naming:

Names like input, eventCommand, and ddlCommand are meaningful, but some variables like ddl could have a more descriptive name.
Variables should be named in a manner that makes their purpose clear. For instance, ddl might be better named as deadlineDetails or similar.
sc has not been defined in the given snippet, so it's unclear what it represents. If it's a Scanner object, a more intuitive name like scanner might be more appropriate.

Based on your class structure, all of the outputs (eg. `system.out.println()`) should be in the Ui class to make it easier to change to a GUI. You can instead add a `showTaskAddedMessage()` method to the Ui class and call it here. Similar for all of the other types of tasks.

Hi Hejin,
I really like the way you have structured your project. It really shows your understanding of what this ip requires.
I have a nit tho. I noticed that there are 2 similar functions in Cheems.java and textUi.java. Is there a reason to have both functions?
Overall, good job for ip so far. Jiayous!

Hi Ming Yuan,
I really like the way you have structured your app and it shows your understanding of what the ip requires. 
I have a nit tho. I noticed that the `filepath` argument in Duke constructor is used for initialising the storage. Perhaps it would be better to name it as `storageFilepath`? This would help facilitate possible future features where Duke needs to read from multiple files, and clarify which filepath belongs to which feature.
Overall, good job for ip. Jiayous!

As the number of keywords increase, perhaps you might want to start looking at enums to have a collection of your keywords!

Looks good to me, although there may be some style errors. Perhaps adding javadoc and header comments for public methods will make your code more clear and easier to understand. Also, according to the Git conventions, you should use "Add", "Settle", "Finalise" instead of "Adds", "Settles", and "Finalises". Overall, well done! 👍

Overall great job on creating the abstraction and encapsulation of each class. I like how you use screaming snake case for static variables which many others missed. Some issue for naming convention for tests can be easily fixed. Perhaps consider packaging different responsibilities into different folders? e.g. task, command, parser, etc folders.

Great job on making your code simple and concise! Perhaps consider abstracting away some logics in your Duke.java into different classes to make your code more modular and readable. I'm not sure if this is your final code at this moment since I don't see any packages and Gradle is not integrated yet. Overall, good work!

Overall good job!  Good use of abstraction using the Task class! However, it might be a better idea to have even more abstraction through the addition of a UI class that handles all the printing and a TaskList class that handles the list of Tasks.

code seems to be a little convoluted, maybe try using enums to replace the if/else statements. For exception handling, i think it would be better if you create separate classes for the different exceptions instead of handling it using if/else

Was a lot cleaner than my own haha. Had extensive documentation which was something I really appreciate.

Overall code is clean and easy to read especially with the intuitive function names e.g. ensureTaskFileExists();
Comments were given everywhere, which was helpful in understanding the code
Test cases were sufficient and handled a majority of the cases

The only issue that I had was with the while loop and switch statements in the main function which I felt was doing too much and could have been better compartmentalised. The indentation was also going in too deep and starting to become like an arrow head.
