Just wanted to check if it's alright to use comments in a sequence diagram to represent long parameters in a sequence diagram. The main reason is because long parameters cause the sequence diagrams to be a lot longer and that reduces the readability on the DG. Thanks!

<panel  header="**5. :fas-info-circle: Resolving JavaFX Cross-Platform Issues with Gradle JavaFX Plugin**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/173" expanded>

## Preface

There has been several issues open about not being able to run the JAR cross-platform for various reasons, most occurring because the Gradle setup for JavaFX was using the following:

```groovy
plugins ``{``
    // ...
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
``}``

javafx ``{``
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
``}``
```

The error is a `QuantumReader` error.

## Solution

I was digging through the official OpenJFX documentation to find a potential fix that continued using the (formerly) second method of importing JavaFX in Gradle:

![Screenshot 2023-09-22 at 09 48 38](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/29497029/52c6a140-9774-4cb6-adbf-34c001bd7f6e)

This is my `build.gradle` now. I've tested out the JAR on a Windows ARM build emulated on Mac M1 Pro machine:

```gradle
plugins ``{``
    // ...
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
``}``

dependencies ``{``
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    implementation group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.10.1'

    // Used for loops to clean up the imports
    def platforms = ["win", "linux", "mac"]
    def javafxDependency = ["javafx-graphics", "javafx-controls", "javafx-fxml"]

    for (plt in platforms) ``{``
        for (dep in javafxDependency) ``{``
            runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:$dep:$javafx.version:$plt"
        ``}``
    ``}``
``}``


// ...

javafx ``{``
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
``}``
```

I am currently setting up VMs (both emulated and virtualized) on a Macbook Pro 14 (M1 Pro) to test various platforms. Would be great if others could try this fix too and see if it resolves their cross-platform issue.

|OS|Architecture|Works?|
|--|------------|------|
|MacOS|ARM (M1 Pro)| ✅ |
|Windows|ARM (Virtualized)| ✅ |
|Windows|x86 (Live Machine)| ✅ |
|Linux|x86 (Ubuntu Live Machine)| ✅ |

Note: I still have the Gradle checkstyle plugin so there is no need to delete it when using this method

I've noticed that even in the textbook, there are sections in Week 4's slides that are collapsed. So I wrote a quick script in JS to auto-expand all of these sections so it's much easier to search for content:

```js
const collapsibles = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.card-header'))
const uncollapsed = collapsibles.filter(node => ``{``
    const glyph = node.querySelector('.glyphicon')
    if (!glyph) return false;
    return glyph.classList.contains('glyphicon-chevron-right')
``}``)
uncollapsed.forEach(node => node.click())
```

To run it, just open the developer console in the page in question and paste in the script into the console and run it

(Noticed that previous semesters have had similar scripts too)

Hope this helps someone! :)

Usually you would create packages under `src/main/java` instead, not as separate packages under `src`. Inspired by the Maven repository structure which I believe Gradle follows as well: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html

It's likely something to do with redirection relying on a single `System.in`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27286690/in-java-is-it-possible-to-re-open-system-in-after-closing-it

When reading input from the redirected file, the first Scanner closes `System.in` and so resulting uses of `System.in` will fail. This doesn't occur in manual input since `System.in` is available for each new line you enter

        break;

I would also add that it's best if you don't try to think of commands as a sequence to memorise but rather as a set of tasks that need to be done, this way it's easier to handle issues like merge conflicts or multiple branches:

1. `git add &lt;file>`: stage the file for the next "snapshot"/commit
2. `git commit -m`: create the "snapshot"/commit with a message
3. `git tag`: provide the current "snapshot"/commit with a human readable tag name
4. `git push`: bring changes from local repository to remote repository, does not include tags
5. `git push --tags`: bring all local tags to remote repository

This way, it's much easier when dealing with larger commits/projects, hope this helps

> a solution to set the default encoding when compiling/running the java program using gradle will be required

I'm not entirely sure if this is even possible to dictate for your users through Gradle 🤔 . Once the program is running, your user's terminal encoding is the one that dictates what characters show up.

One really hack-y way is to forcefully set your user's terminal encoding by directly running commands when your bot starts such as using `Runtime.exec()` (https://www.baeldung.com/run-shell-command-in-java). You could try playing around with the `LC_ALL` of the user's configuration to see if that ensures "global" viewing but as pointed out in [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36184019/is-it-possible-force-utf-8-in-a-c-program), doing this could be a very slippery slope as the user's encoding affects things outside of just displaying the symbols

For Unix systems, `LC_ALL` seems to be sufficient but for Windows, you might need to try this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35549962/lc-all-c-equivalent-for-windows-using-powershell

Just recompile the files with Java 11 and they'll be "Java 11". You don't have to downgrade your Java version. `jenv` is a way to manage multiple Java installations (if you're on MacOS): https://www.jenv.be/

If you're on Windows, believe you can just install Java 11 and point the path variable to the Java 11 installation instead (but I've not used Windows in quite a while so any Windows folks, feel free to correct me)

I think the main idea is to have a **logical separation** of concerns and to not create new classes for the sake of creating a class. This goes back to what the problem is. Let's say you are trying to implement a builder pattern, out of necessity, a secondary (usually nested) `Builder` class is needed. This is a logical separation of work since you need this `Builder` class for you to be able to properly implement the pattern. An instance where creating a class for the sake of creating a class is going to be redundant is in cases where you have a single utility method used in a single location but you try abstracting it out into a "utility" class just because you can. In those scenarios, I would just leave the utility method in the class it is used since it's not going to ever be used outside.

Besides the "need" concern, I think a bigger component of modularity is the ability to have finer unit testing. Larger modules/classes imply that you have a lot more surface area to cover for a unit test. This is not a bad thing per-se but being able to modularize the code means that you decouple long dependency chains so that each unit test covers exactly one component and does not have to overextend its testing. One very good example is the `Parser` class in iP where having a separate class means you can individually test `parse()` without having to worry about setting up the file storage or making sure the bot is running.

For most web frameworks (think Gin for Go, Spring Boot for Java, Phoenix for Elixir), it is not uncommon to see a high level of modularity when building out a single endpoint. Usually you have a router to handle the web routes, then you have a controller to handle the HTTP request, and then a set of models that the controller uses, and finally a data layer that connects with the database. This modularity, while verbose and tedious at times, gives a very clear flow of what goes where and the roles each class/module plays. Even in desktop applications, you might see architectures like the Model-View-Controller (MVC) where you already have three layers of modularity.

Tl;dr: dividing into multiple classes is a double edged sword, it gives clear visibility and responsibility to each file which makes testing a lot easier but overdoing it because you can is bound to make the code more unreadable and harder to navigate

I've forked your repository and managed to rectify the issue. The primary issue is the use of `Pane` to wrap your dialog messages (for some odd reason, it does not allow the wrap text to work as expected). You can use `HBox` to arrange the content already. You also need to configure the parent container (`VBox` in `ScrollPane`) to have a fixed width too. I've updated the view through FXML directly so I removed the `children` nodes but the general logic applies. You might want to re-adjust some of the values I hardcoded to suit your needs but believe it's best to show what changes were needed:

`MainWindow.fxml`:

```xml
<AnchorPane maxHeight="-Infinity" maxWidth="-Infinity" minHeight="-Infinity" minWidth="-Infinity" prefHeight="600.0"
            prefWidth="400.0" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1"

    <Button fx:id="sendButton" layoutX="324.0" layoutY="558.0" mnemonicParsing="false" onAction="#handleUserInput"
            prefHeight="41.0" prefWidth="76.0" text="Send"/>
&gt;!-- here -->
    <ScrollPane fx:id="scrollPane" hbarPolicy="NEVER" prefHeight="557.0" prefWidth="400.0"
                styleClass="chat" stylesheets="@../css/Application.css" vvalue="1.00" hvalue="1.0">
        <VBox fx:id="dialogContainer" prefWidth="388.0"/>
    </ScrollPane>
</AnchorPane>
```

`DialogBox.fxml`:

```xml
<fx:root alignment="TOP_RIGHT" maxHeight="Infinity" maxWidth="1.7976931348623157E308" prefWidth="400.0"
         type="javafx.scene.layout.HBox" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17.0.2-ea" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">
    <padding>
        <Insets bottom="15.0" left="10.0" right="10.0" top="15.0"/>
    </padding>
    <Circle fx:id="circle" fill="#007df2" radius="23.0" stroke="BLACK" strokeType="INSIDE" strokeWidth="0.0">
        <HBox.margin>
            <Insets left="10.0" right="10.0"/>
        </HBox.margin>
    </Circle>
    <Label fx:id="dialog" prefWidth="350.0" text="Label with long text that should wrap to the next line when needed." wrapText="true">
        <font>
            <Font name="Segoe UI" size="14.0"/>
        </font>
        <padding>
            <Insets bottom="15" top="15" left="20" right="20" />
        </padding>
    </Label>
</fx:root>
```

`DialogBox.java`: instead of styling the `Pane`, you can apply the styles directly to the `Label`

```java

        dialog.setText(text);
        circle.setFill(new ImagePattern(img));
        if (isUser) ``{``
            dialog.getStyleClass().add("blue-background");
        ``}`` else ``{``
            dialog.getStyleClass().add("lavender-background");
        ``}``
```

To give some more context for future reference (and those who encounter similar issue). The fixes that I applied are as such:

1. Remove the use of Pane since `HBox` already handles alignment of content
2. Remove the `prefHeight` attribute of the `VBox` inside `ScrollPane` since that would cause scrolling issues with longer texts from my experience
3. Set the `prefWidth` of the `Label` directly so that there is a specified container size
4. Set the background styling directly onto the `Label`, not the `Pane`

I generally try to think of FXML + CSS in terms of HTML flexbox so that helps with understanding the way to layout content

Could I ask why you want to compile the files? 

Once you start importing public libraries, it becomes increasingly more challenging to manually compile the code. You do not need to manually compile your Java code with Gradle since it does it for you. That's the whole purpose of using a package management tool instead of manually downloading and managing your dependencies (see CMake and C++ for why this is tedious and painful)

The reason this is failing is because Gradle downloaded the dependencies from the internet and you are not including them when you compile your programs

Edit: manually compiling all the JavaFX dependencies would mean downloading the JAR files and using the following command: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9395207/how-to-include-jar-files-with-java-file-and-compile-in-command-prompt

The `.idea/` folder is ignored by `.gitignore`. Also, I don't seem to see a `config/checkstyle/configuration.xml` in your project root. The instructions from the notes should be done sequentially, so once you setup the `configuration.xml`, then you can add it to the Intellij project

I personally do not see an alternative to testing it as is. I view unit testing practices as guidelines that should be done when possible. In this scenario, if you are worried about the reliability of returning the instance `Bar`, then the thing you should focus on is not the fact that there is a dependency, but rather, making sure that `Bar` is properly unit tested separately. This way, you are "guaranteed" that `fooMethod` would not be buggy.

The key here is to make sure `Bar` is independently tested (or as much as it can be) and that way, you are sure there is no issues returning a new instance of it from `Foo`. You shouldn't need to test the `Bar` object returned from `fooMethod` inside `Foo` since then you would have overlapping unit tests. So there's two separate test files, `BarTest` and `FooTest` and you don't mix the unit tests

That's my take on this

I think this really boils down to what is defined as a magic literal. An interesting paper I found was this: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584922000908

And it defines magic literals as 

> Magic literals are such values used without an explicit explanation of their meaning.

So the key component to what makes magic literals magic is the fact that there is a lack of **explicit** explanation of their meaning. In the case of 'String.format()', the strings that you use are self-explanatory, they are simply the contents to print and the interpolated variables should be explained in their own ways. So I don't think that this is a magic literal and it does not affect the readability of the code.

As for whether it is alright to use magic strings, I see this as being a similar problem to writing SQL code in another language. For instance, is it better to include the SQL query directly like (using Go to illustrate but the idea applies):

'''go
db.Query('
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE username = $1
', username)
'''

Or if it's better to abstract this query into a separate string such as:

'''go
const QUERY = '
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE username = $1
'

db.Query(QUERY, username)
'''

I think in this case, having an extra layer of abstraction might actually make it harder to understand the intent of the code and make it harder to trace. You could imagine the 'QUERY' being stored in a separate file so you will have to jump between files to figure out these magic literals. I think the SQL string is self-explanatory, albeit slightly long but it doesn't really violate SLAP since it's still along the same level of abstraction.

This is just my take on this though, would love to hear what others think!

> Moving it to one location as a NAMED_CONSTANT can make future updates to it easier and less error-prone.

I agree, however, I might argue that if it's used in `String.format()`, it's unlikely to be reused so moving it to another location could be considered as a premature optimisation that might not be necessary. I think this really boils down to the context and use case of the literal.

This is my `build.gradle` now. I've tested out the JAR on a Windows ARM build emulated on Mac M1 Pro machine:

```gradle
dependencies ``{``
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    implementation group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.10.1'

    // Used for loops to clean up the imports
    def platforms = ["win", "linux", "mac"]
    def javafxDependency = ["javafx-graphics", "javafx-controls", "javafx-fxml"]

    for (plt in platforms) ``{``
        for (dep in javafxDependency) ``{``
            runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:$dep:$javafx.version:$plt"
        ``}``
    ``}``
``}``


// ...

javafx ``{``
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
``}``
```

Would be great if others could help perform a quick smoke test on native Windows machines. Perhaps this was the fix missing for the second method of setting up JavaFX:

|MacOS|ARM (M1 Pro)| ✅ |

The JAR file is still on Java version 13. I just tested it on my machine too. Could you try re-building the JAR via Intellij's Gradle task manager instead? I have a feeling your terminal's Java version is still 13 so even when you ran `./gradlew shadowJar`, it was still using Java 13, not 11 as per your project

Think there's some missing context, like what is "building the `shadowJar`? Are you referring to using Intellij's built-in JARing? If so, then it's not working because it does not build a fat JAR that contains all the dependencies like JavaFX and JUnit. ShadowJAR resolves this by handling it for you when you run `./gradlew shadowJar`.

You might want to read up more about what fat JARs are and the types of JARs you can get:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19150811/what-is-a-fat-jar
- https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/introduction/

Further clarification: Intellij's built-in JARing functionality is not the same as ShadowJAR, so using Intellij's JARing does not immediately guarantee that you are building a fat JAR

The beauty of Git and version control is that you get to work asynchronously and sync your work anytime in the flow (but before you push to `master`). Generally, if the upstream `master` is updated, you could merge the latest changes into your branch using:

```
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master
```

Run on your local branch, before anymore dev work. But fret not if you did not do so, you can do it after you've finished your changes, or through Github's PR UI that will also prompt you to merge to `master` to remain latest before you can merge your PR :)

Hi, our team received multiple bug reports regarding the error message provided is less helpful when users inputed negative index/zero(e.g. `delete -1` would show a command format error rather than index out of bound error). This behaviour is expected as we specified that index should be in the range of `[1, 2147483647]`, which makes 0 and negative indices not a valid input to index, hence a command format error.

We are going to accept this bug as a NotInScope feature flaw, but we are not very sure whether or not both cases (i.e. 0 and negative indices) can be considered a duplicate or must he seperate bugs.

So the fix required is to modify the parse index method to not only accept unsigned positive integers, but also negative integers and zero, one could argue that these can be fixed separately (i.e. we can fix the parsing to accept zero but not negative and vice versa), but we think that since both zero and negative integers are within the same equivalence partition, it would also be valid to say both should be fixed together. That is, we think that they seem like one enhancement rather than two, as it wouldn't make sense to accept 0 which is already out of our current allowed indices range, but still reject negative indices.

However, we are not very sure can we merge these bugs as duplicate and is seeking advice here.

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: Some questions regarding documentation bugs**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/494" expanded>

I have the following two questions regarding documentation bugs:

1. We have a bug report related to naming of our target users, so basically the majority of the documentation, we used `Customers` to name our target users, but in our class diagram (which was inherited from the AB3, the classes are called `Person` and some other related namings such as `PersonListPanel`, `PersonCard` etc). So we received a bug stating that our naming in diagrams should also be kept consistent with other sections of the documentation so that the reader can understand it more easily. Our interpretation is that, our class diagram is actually not wrong, as it shows the correct class names, but we also agreed that if we were to change the namings in our implementation it would make the reader understand the context easier. So we were planning to classify this as not in scope (as we think that rectifying the naming is not as important as other features we implemented), but we are not very sure whether is this actually a documentation bug or not, since our documentation is technically correct, and if it is, are we allowed to classify documentation bugs as not in scope?

2. How detailed does the manual testing part need to be? As we thought that we were just required to provide certain test cases for the tester to begin with, we did not include much detail in it, which ended up being reported as bugs(i.e. we did not include prerequisites for a test case). So for example, we provided a test case `delete 1` with the expected output being successful deletion of customer at index 1, however, the tester stated that we should include a prerequisite of the displayed list having at least 1 customer, or else the test case will have a different output. We think that this is valid too, but since we though that the manual testing section was more of just a few examples provided for the testers to test, we think that this bug is kind of not in scope, as we think that this is a good to have, but without it the tester can still use our test cases to test the product. 

3. As for the other dev docs linked in the DG, since they are not graded, if the links were broken (i.e. the Setting up, getting started and Documentation, logging, testing, configuration, dev-ops), can be it reported as a bug? As we understood that it is not graded, we did not actually went to test these links, but it ended up to be broken (as we generated our pdf using local host).<img width="748" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-19 at 3 14 59 PM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/122191710/3a0e9398-488c-43ff-a5f5-f72f1200fea1">

As mentioned in the title, if we were to reject a bug, it implies that there should not be any bug type and severity, however, we are not provided with the option to set the bug type and severity to none.

I came across this scenario when considering possible bugs in PE, that there is a feature that can be used but not documented and I am thinking what kind of bug is this. Consider the following cases:

**Case 1:** 
The team actually wanted the feature, but forgot to document about it. I would deem this to be a documentation bug.

**Case 2:**
The team did not want the feature to be included in their application, but they could possibly forgot to remove it and was inherited from AB3. Then this would be a functionality bug right? As the application is not functioning as it is supposed to be.

Then for both cases, would the severity of the bug be determined by what kind of consequences could arise from using that feature? For instance, clearing the whole data (the clear command from the AB3) could be quite a severe case as it is a destructive and non-recoverable operation, so maybe severity.Medium/severity.High?

On top of that, as it is fully up to the developer team to decide on whether they wanted to include such features, are there any guidelines on how we should determine which case it is? If it were to be case1, we might need to consider whether the feature has any flaws or not, but for case2, since the feature was not supposed to be there at the first place, any flaws in the feature should not be reported too.

I am wondering what kind of severity should we categorise errors in UML diagrams to? Does it depend on how the error affects the readability/understandability?

A simple example would be, in a sequence diagram where we want to indicate loops:

**Scenario 1:**
We used the label `for` instead of `loop` in the top left corner.
I would categorise this as a severity.veryLow since it does not actually cause misunderstanding, rather just a wrong notation.

**Scenario 2:**
We used the label `opt` instead of `loop` in the top left corner.
This would then upgrade to a severity.Low or severity.Medium since it will cause misunderstanding?

If the above example is correct, would that mean syntax/notation errors that do not cause misunderstanding can be categorised as severity.veryLow bugs, whereas bugs that actually cause misunderstanding will categorised from severity.Low upwards depending on how much it affects? But then there would be a grey area of when the diagram is too cluttered which affects readability(even though the diagram is totally correct), which I am not very sure how we should categorise, since it is technically a cosmetic issue, but it will also heavily affect readers to understand the diagram.

All in all, I understand that a lot of these need to be determined on a case by case basis, but I am just wondering whether are there any general guidelines on categorising severity of UML diagram errors?

Hi, our team is currently planning on what to include in our planned enhancements and came across this enhancement that we plan to include, and we think that this enhancement is suitable for two different features(which behaves nearly identically).

Specifically saying, the two features are the [tag](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w16-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#tagging-a-customer-tag) and [insurance](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w16-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#updating-insurance-of-a-customer-insurance) features, and the planned enhancement is stated [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w16-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#appendix-planned-enhancements).

For deciding between two alternatives for a certain behaviour of a feature, since it is impossible to get the best of both worlds, is justifying that the pros of the current behaviour outweigh the cons sufficient for the bug to be categorised as not in scope?

Specifically saying, our product has a feature that allows users to add or delete multiple tags in one command, we have decided to ignore deletion of non-existing tags (as we believe that it is better not to disallow the command that may include multiple tags to update just because of one error tag), however, this will cause a problem of error message not being specific enough(say the user deletes only one non-existing tag, the error message will say that the person is not updated). Originally I was planning to include this in my planned enhancements, but I felt that it was like an either A or B choice, its not possible to get both A and B.

Are there any suggestions to handle these kinds of situations?

Ahh totally agree with that, however, for the sake of following the naming convention, do you think that we should name private static final variables as constants? Or do we have to analyse whether the variable is indeed immutable and is actually a constant before applying the naming convention to it?

The problematic behaviour is as reported [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/issues/256), which I totally agree too, but I'm not quite sure what I can to resolve this problematic behaviour if I were to keep my original design choice(which I think has more benefits).

Hi, as I was examining my UML diagrams to spot out possible notation errors, I came across this question of whether method names in sequence diagrams are compulsory(as they are not stated as optional elements, I took it as compulsory), but if so, may I confirm that writing the constructor method name in sequence diagrams is not compulsory(as it might make the diagram more complicated if the constructor takes in a lot of arguments), so a diagram as follows is correct:

Okay, thank you for your response.

> Also, in the example diagram, it is better to use result:CommandResult rather than give object name as a return value. It is implied that the constructor returns the constructed object (i.e., no need to specify a return value).

Regarding this, is the current notation in the above diagram wrong? Or is it just less straightforward? I used the following notation as I need to use the name `result` as a return value of another function, as follows:

<img width="416" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 5 17 43 PM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/122191710/143c2245-8f8f-432b-8d7b-3a240c719fcc">

But if I were to use `result:CommandResult`, as it is increasing the width of the whole diagram, it will cause the fonts to shrink(which I feel like is also less ideal).

As I was considering the case where the feature is not documented in the UG, but useable in the app, however the dev team might not intended that this feature to exist in the app. So since it is not documented in the UG/DG, the dev team are allowed to disown the feature right? But since it is still usable, hence considered a functionality bug.

@damithc

> As implied by the last bullet point above, broken links in the DG are considered DG bugs, even if the content of those destination pages are not graded.

I see, but one of the teams reported this bug to be a severity.High, can we use the fact that these sections are not actually graded to counter this, since the content of the destination pages are not graded, having a broken link to those pages are not as of high severity in our course?

Hmm, but from another point of view, as we are still being graded under the context of the course, the fact that the destination page is not graded is one of the factors that caused us to miss this during our developer testing stage, as we would subconsciously ignore these sections. On top of that, the broken link issue only arises when the reader is using the pdf version (which is also another restriction enforced by the course, if we were putting ourselves in the shoes of the developer, using the website version could also be an easy workaround).

As a side note, the tester did not actually provide any justification on why they think this broken link is a very severe issue (they only stated that the link is broken), hence it is even more harder for us to state our stance and arguments on why we do not agree that it is a severity.High bug.

@damithc 

Sorry but I have one more question, since all these broken links are caused by the fact that we used the local host to generate the pdf, they could not be fixed independently, hence flagged as a duplicate by us. However, are we required to provide a response to each bug(after flagging them as a duplicate of the "original" bug)? As there is one report on broken images links (also because of the local host), and the reporter might not find the explanation and response we provided to the "orginal" bug useful as it was mainly explaining based on the `getting started` broken links case. Do we add an additional response to the specific bug? As the severity and bug type reported in that specific bug matches our decision.

Hi prof, jumping in to also seek clarification regarding wrong duplicate flagging, so if the tester flagged multiple bugs as duplicate, but in fact they aren't (they are similar bugs but not individually fixable), how would the severity, type and respond be determined for the non-duplicate bug(do we need to decide on whether or not to disagree with their respond to the "original" bug)?

Hi @s-peiran , thanks for pitching in, the case was that the dev team just said that the feature is functioning as it is supposed to be, but I did not report is as a functionality bug, rather a feature flaw with my reasoning on why I think this feature has a flaw. Hence, his response on saying that it is stated in the UG is basically not responding to the bug report(his respond just shows that it is not a functionality bug).

> @yucongkoo the team not giving sufficient reasons for the downgrade tilts the case in your favor. Nevertheless, you can provide a justification why you chose that severity/type to further increase your chance of a favorable decision in the next phase.

Ahh okay, because what I did was that I provided explanations on why I think that the current behaviour might be flawed and problematic, but the team totally did not respond to any of my stance, so I am not sure what they do not agree with me( nor why they think that it is not a bug) 

But anyways, I will still provide my justifications in the response to further elaborate why I initially think that it is flawed. Thank you prof.

During the merging process, I believe I should have tagged and pushed the commit after every successfuly merge conflict handling. However, I have just finished everything and then pushed the master branch and the three parallel branches when I realised this problem.

How should I approach this? Is it okay to tag this current commit (done with all the merge) three times with three different tags?

I have a method handleInput() that takes in the parsed user input to output corresponding text, based on the first word of the input (commands). But there's a lot of commands possible, so my handleInput() function spans around 100 lines of code (due to all the if else conditions)

Is this still within the limits? if not, then where should the helper methods be created? in the Ui class or the Parser class?

Hi Prof, 

Above is an example sequence diagram covered in the tutorial. I was confused as to how "simple" should the diagram be.

Say I have a sequence diagram which has 2 linear method calls. (For example, from `AddCommand`'s `execute` method, three method calls are propagated, of which 2 method calls are to two other classes in `Logic` component, and the last one to the `Model` component). The method calls to the 2 classes in `Logic` immediately return to `AddCommand`. I then proceed to show the low-level details within the `Model` component. 

Is this considered violating the "simplicity" of the diagram due to "showing low-level details for more than one component". The purpose of the diagram is to show the method call propagation, which covers the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` components. 

I am having difficulty squaring this with making the diagram represent as close to implementation as possible and fitting the purpose. If you do think that the proposed diagram is too complex how do you suggest simplying it?

  
</panel>

<panel  header="**8. :fas-info-circle: Details regarding Sequence Diagram**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/411" expanded>

Hi Prof, 

1. Can the arguments for the methods involved in the sequence diagram not be shown for simplicity sake?

Or if needs to be shown, can we choose to omit objects within the arguments that are not involved in the sequence diagram (meaning as a boxed class at the top of the diagram?)

2. Consider a static nested class B within class A. Say within class C, `randomMethod` makes a call to the constructor of class B.

```
public class A ``{``
    A (String str) ``{`` ``}``
    public static class B extends A ``{``
        B (String str) ``{``
           super(str)
        ``}``
    ``}`` 
``}``
```

```
public class C ``{``
     public void randomMethod() ``{``
         A.B("Hello");
     ``}``
``}``
```

During the instantiation of class B, should class B take the label `<<class>> B` or just `B`.
The confusion here is regarding the `static` nature of the nested class.

3. In which cases is it appropriate to show an object de-reference? Is it only in the case when a method returns an object or throws an exception?

From what I understand, email validation is not only a matter of REGEX matching, but also involves some form of DNS lookup or SMTP check which requires an internet connection.

From what I have read, it seems to me like this could potentially be `out of scope`, but I am not sure on this.

The code below was given for the task in week 2 where we have to extract out the classes `Storage`, `TaskList` and `Ui`. 

```java
public class Duke ``{``
    private Storage storage;
    private TaskList tasks;
    private Ui ui;

    public Duke(String filePath) ``{``
        ui = new Ui();
        storage = new Storage(filePath);
        try ``{``
            tasks = new TaskList(storage.load());
        ``}`` catch (DukeException e) ``{``
            ui.showLoadingError();
            tasks = new TaskList();
        ``}``
    ``}``

    public void run() ``{``
        //...
    ``}``

    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        new Duke("data/tasks.txt").run();
    ``}``
``}``
```

Could I ask if exact naming standard are imposed? (in other words, if my `TaskList` class is called `CustomList`, will it still be accepted? Or do I have to rename it due to possible automated script checks?)

On top of what @larrywang0701 has said, the iP dashboard is updated daily. So you might need to come back tommorow to see if the script has detected your tag.

If you are still facing issues, you can use these following commands. 

1. Open up your terminal and navigate to your iP folder
2. Type command `git log` to list all the recent commits

For example, mine looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/96157054/c80d85d6-a39a-47cb-a104-7a180a7fba6e)

&hat;My tag above is listed with the merge commit, so I know the merge commit has been tagged correctly. 

From your screenshot, it seems to me that your tag is not attached to the merge commit, which might be what is causing the issue.

1. Run `git log` and make sure all your commits are synced with your local repositiory
2. Delete the old tag from your local repository using `git tag -d &lt;tag-name>`
3. Create the tag on the new commit using `git tag &lt;tag-name> &lt;hash-of-the-merge-commit>`
4. Delete the old tag from the remote repositiory `git push origin --delete &lt;tag-name>`
5. Push the new tag to the remote repository `git push origin &lt;tag-name>`

This method has worked for me before, and it should for you as well 😊

Ok, looks like a Intellij environment related problem. 

**Compare environment between terminal and intellij**
Run `./gradelew -g` from the command line to print the environment variables and system properties. Compare this to the environment in Intellij(`Run` > `Edit Configurations` > `Environment variables`) to make sure if they match.

Update it here if possible also!

**Delete all .idea and .iml files**
These files could have become corrupted. Delete them and relaunch Intellij. Intellij should restore those fiiles.

Actually I think i noticed the culprit. In the image that you attached at the start of the thread, I noticed that you have a `ParserTest` class that is not in a subdirectory of its own. 

You can do following.
1. If your `Parser` class is not in a package, house it under a package. 
2. Then, make sure the test directory follows the **SAME** file structure as your main code. 

I would expect the `ParserTest` to be under a nested directory and not hanging outside by itself, if this is done correctly. 

Reasoning:
Intellij attempts to understand your file structure and generates test build based off its understanding. So, it is highly likely Intellij has misinterpreted your file stucture. As to why your tests run correctly with your `gradelew` command, I think it is because the build was generated before you made some code changes. Those code changes between the last time you built the jar artifact and now is what caused your test to not run correctly in Intellij.

Further help:
Could you share your full test structure if you don't mind? 

Let me know if this helps in any way

Referring to the image above, `ParserTest` seems to be under package Duke, but from the file structure of your main code, it seems `Parser` is in `main` > `java` > `Duke` > `Tasks` > `Parser`. So I believe the correct test directory should be to move the `ParserTest` into the `Tasks` test directory.

It seems Intellij itself doesn't recognise the test file in this directory, as `ParserTest` is notably highlighted in blue.

I believe the problem is in your build gradle file. Even though in the build task, you have indicated option for `depends on("distZip", "distJar")`, shadow jar probably didn't detect any dependencies associated with those (other) distributions.

Maybe you could try modifying the dependencies task your build gradle file to this 

```java
dependencies ``{``
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    testImplementation 'org.mockito:mockito-core:3.12.4'

    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.8'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'

    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.8'
``}``
```
Of course, this would install javaFx version 17.0.8 in your repository (change it to your preferred version)

> &hat;The above is mine. Seems like that might be the issue since it looks like there are only distributions for mac OS but not other OSes. However, my build.gradle file does not have what you have since I used the second method to do set up JavaFX. Adding your recommended dependencies breaks my checkstyle file. Thanks for the hint though!!

**Old dependencies that worked**
```java
org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:mac-aarch64:17:0:7

Yes yes, the linkage error is caused by Java Fx dependencies. A couple of people who used Java Fx on Mac have faced the same problem regarding the jar file distribution. Hopefully we can find a solution to this.

1. So if I understand you correctly, the X is not compulsory notation - only if you want to demonstrate the "object being thrown away", you will use it.

2. Regarding the correctness of the X, after a sequence of linear method calls, won't all objects be irrelevant after deactivation? In that case when is it meaningful to put an X underneath?

Maybe a small example of when it is meaningful to show the X would help.

Thank you!

@damithc But is this ok under the implementation section? The purpose was defined by me while writing documentation for the implementation. I understand that while explaning parts under `Logic`, `Model` should be listed as an API, however, the grey area is when the diagram is under implementation.

@damithc 
> @AlagappanRa As a workaround, you can split it into multiple diagrams, each containing lower level details of no more one component.

What is an example of this workaround.

Is it one diagram that shows `Model` as API and another that shows `Logic` as an API stacked one on top of each other? Or side-by-side? 

Or alternatively, it will just be ok to simplify it to a single diagram and making either component an API right?

Are we allowed to freely edit what is shown in this box?

For context, our app has Contacts and Meeting classes, and Meeting can contain contacts in a list. 
When we try to delete a contact from a meeting, there are two situations. The contact does not exist at all, and the contact does not exist in the meeting. The current feedback text is too general, and I want to make it specific that reflects which scenario it belongs to.

But my bigger question is whether we can change freely the output in this box regardless of the situation.

Issue: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/issues/162
 
Right now my meeting class is holding an ArrayList of the contacts it contains.

To change the behavior, we will have an ArrayList in Contact class that keep tracks of the Meetings that contains it (ObserverList). If the contact is delete via deleteContact command, the contact object will notify all the meetings in the observerList to remove the contact from its own ArrayList.

2. Currently we allow the user to filter the meeting by start time and end time. However, I have used the LocalDateTime isAfter(other) and isBefore(other) function, which is non-inclusive on the dateTime that the user has input. The filter should be inclusive of the user input so that the user can search for a meeting that falls under the exact dateTime by stipulating the same startTime and endTime. Am I allowed to make the time inclusive of the user input?

If we were to convert the entire app into case in-sensitive, it will requires a 1 line change to how we check whether two contacts are the same in AddContactToMeeting class and DeleteContactFromMeeting class

While waiting for prof to reply let me offer my 2 cents. Firstly, this feature flaw you pointed out must not be under their planned enhancements. Personally, I don't think that arguing the stuff in their planned enhancements are of lower priority than this feature flaw you pointed out is a strong argument. I suggest you argue from the fundamental of this feature flaw and why it is not suitable.

Hi Prof,

[Bug Report Link](https://github.com/lihongguang00/pe/issues/8)

The bug report in question is a `feature flaw`. The current state of feature that I believe is flawed uses GUI buttons rather than keyboard (with no other alternative), which is makes it not keyboard friendly.  However, in one of the `Planned Enhancement`, they did mention adding CLI based commands that would indirectly address this feature flaw. However, my original argument was more of that the team has had their priorities wrong (since they could have spent the time implementing the GUI button into adding a `listener` to the GUI for keyboard support instead), and I was wondering if this would violate the module's PE guidelines if I were to reject their response (which they rejected the bug report), since it is technically addressed to some degree?

Hi prof/TAs,

Our team has 2 queries regarding the duplicate bug report grading.

Our team has 1 pair of duplicate bug report, one with `low` severity and other with `high` severity.  We are certain that they are duplicates, and having accepted the `low` severity bug report, we subsequently labelled the `high` severity as a duplicate. In this case, are we penalized according to the highest severity among the duplicates (i.e. `high` in this case), or the one that we have chosen to accept? 

Additionally, in the case the lower severity bug report is accepted, would the tester that reported a `high` severity get credit for the `high` severity level or `low` severity? This is a concern because the tester seemed to have overstated the severity level with unsubstantial arguments for it, and the team would like to respond with an argument for a lower severity level for the `high` severity bug report even though we have labelled it as a duplicate.

Our team is having a peculiar issue with our UI where on 1 of our groupmate's computer (as well as 1 PED tester's computer), the UI is inconsistent with the rest the team's UI (and rest of the PED testers' computers). 

When said group mate replicated the bug, we copied over the data files from his computer and ran it on our computers, but the UI looks fine on the rest of our computers. Since we all use windows, it dosen't seem like it is OS dependent.

For part of my UI in JavaFX, I have separate classes for the container and elements contains within the container, and I need the dimensions of the container and it's elements to be consistent (Or else the container might outgrow the elements contained).

Hello friends,

To set the context, I am looking to implement a calendar feature for the tP. Following the project structure of AB3, I added a class called `Calendar` to model a calendar, which would store `Event` objects.

Now, I want to implement a command that allows the user to delete some `Event` at some index (similar to the delete function in the iP). Again, following the structure of AB3, I would add a `DeleteEvent` command class, and a `DeleteEventParser` class to handle user input for this command. Naturally, this would mean that for any user input that is invalid (e.g. calendar only has a total of 2 events, but user tries to delete the event at index 10), it would be caught at the `DeleteEventParser` level. Now, I am wondering what would be the better practice to write my `Calendar` class `deleteAt(int index)` method, knowing that the index will definitely be valid?

(A) No assumption about `index` validity
```
public void deleteAt(int index) ``{``
    if (index < 0 || index > this.size - 1) ``{``
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException()
    ``}``

    eventList.delete(index);
``}``
```

(B) Assuming `index` is always valid: 
```
public void deleteAt(int index) ``{``
    assert(0 <= index < this.size); // Assert that the index is at least 0, and at most the calendar's size -1

    eventList.delete(index);
``}``
```

Personally, I have chosen to adopt approach B, and I am now having trouble doing testing for this method because I am unsure of how to test the `assert(0 <= index < this.size)` statement. Any help would be appreciated!

Hi, codecov is to ensure that your code is well tested.

To pass patch, you need to ensure that for new code that you are adding, at least ~75% of it needs to be well tested with Junit

To pass project, you need to ensure that overall ~75% of your whole project needs to be well tested with JUnit.

The way the % is calculated is based on lines tested i'm guessing, but i'm not too sure. Anyways you just have to do more testing of your code, and it should hopefully pass!

> @lihongguang00 It might help to share the relevant code, or point to a relevant PR.

Hi prof,

Unfortunately, I do not have any PR or code to point to because I have chosen to take another route around it. 

But to give more context for the purposes of discussion, our project involves a calendar system (similar to NUSMods), and we have a `StackPane` (container) that holds the 1. background of the calendar and 2. the event cards for the calendar. However, because our team wanted to make the calendar only display the necessary time periods to minimise clutter (similar to how NUSMods will change the time periods displayed according to the earliest class and latest class of the day), this requires the width of the background to be updated (as more hours displayed will require more pixels). As a result, the container is not synchronized with the background, resulting in spaces in the container that are not filled by the background. Hence, the intention was to use binding as a means of synchronising their widths.

I am using VSCode and forked AB3, but I cannot run the tests using JUnit the old way.

The green test button is there, but I click it and then nothing noteworthy happens, you can even see on the top left hand side it says no test results yet.
Thankfully gradle tests still function and has feedbacked that some of these tests do not pass, but it becomes hard to debug when I cannot press the green button and see it running.

update: I refreshed the checkstyle extension checkstyle file path to checkstyle.xml again, and suddenly there is no red underline in the edittor. But the gradle still gives the checkstyle error, which makes me unable to build the app.

When I build this, I do not get a tailing whitespace style error in between 
```
     * CHECKSTYLE.OFF: Regexp
     *  
     * CHECKSTYLE.ON: Regexp
```
    
But I still get an error for the line length.

Also, when I change the length in the XML file to 180, it does fix the issue, but the checkstyle off is buggy nonetheless

Changing the tool version in the build.gradle to the latest 10.12.3 instead of the 10.2 in the guide fixed it.

I helped a friend with a very niche and difficult issue with nullpointer/failure to load even though my filepath was correct.

I suspect it was because the github code base was in a onedrive folder, and an item in the folder had spaces in it. After many hours I tried moving the whole code to local desktop and without changing any code it worked just like that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. (It also worked if I moved it to another one drive folder that didn't have spaces in its filepath)

Hi prof,

I understand that a feature flaw is reported if a feature exhibits incomplete behaviour.

But for instance, if it happens so that the UI does not display the data unless the user clicks on it. Would that be counted as a feature flaw (since the behaviour is deemed incomplete)?

Hi guys, thank you for the suggestions. When I went to check the list of files using command E, I was unable to see the gradle in the tools tab. I suspect my gradle file has been only partially installed. But I can also see all the gradle folders, libraries and gradlew wrapper files too. How do I fix this issue? Is there a way to reinstall gradle but also keep my latest work?

My jar file (made on Mac) also yielded linkage errors for Windows. My issue was resolved when I ran java --version on the terminal. Turns out, I was using OpenJDK version 20, and had to downgrade to 11 by manually deleting the other OpenJDK files of the other versions.

I see, thank you Prof. As a follow up, if the bug is most likely deemed not in scope due to a difficulty in its implementation, then could it be categorised as a documentation bug (either in UG/DG) instead? Since the users should be made aware of the current limitations?

Also, may I clarify, suppose the DG has planned enhancements on some extension. However, the UG does not contain that same information on current limitations, it can be categorised as a documentation bug of Medium intensity? Especially since the limitations can cause some unintended data loss?

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Java Coding Standard: Blanks between logical units**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/553" expanded>

Hi prof, I am confused as to what constitutes a "logical unit". I was under the impression that the coding standards were objective, but this rule seems to be ambiguous. 

Here is the relevant section from the textbook regarding this: 
### ☆☆ Logical units within a block should be separated by one blank line.
```
// Create a new identity matrix
Matrix4x4 matrix = new Matrix4x4();

// Precompute angles for efficiency
double cosAngle = Math.cos(angle);
double sinAngle = Math.sin(angle);

// Specify matrix as a rotation transformation
matrix.setElement(1, 1,  cosAngle);
matrix.setElement(1, 2,  sinAngle);
matrix.setElement(2, 1, -sinAngle);
matrix.setElement(2, 2,  cosAngle);

// Apply rotation
transformation.multiply(matrix);
```
> Rationale: Enhances readability by introducing white space between logical units. Each block is often introduced by a comment as indicated in the example above.

---

The example given in the textbook makes sense, but it's hard to judge whether to apply the rule in other contexts. For example, in the mock quiz: 

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/108869153/fb6d68fb-6368-4640-961f-5bd739e9a763)

In addition to the other violations, should there be a blank line between the line 2 (declaration of a variable) and line 3 (for loop)?
If there is, how should we indicate it for such questions? which line is the error in?
If there isn't, why?

Here is the code snippet for ease of reference: 

```
public void read_lines() ``{``
    int FILE_SIZE = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) ``{``
        read("reading " + FILE_SIZE); // read
    ``}``
``}``

Hi! Currently for our app, if we sort the list of companies, it shows the user the full list of companies, even if they have a filtered list that initially only shows a subset of the full list, which is different from what we intended and what's in the user guide, which states that it sorts the current showed list.

If I have different fields in my application (for e.g. Name, Company Name), and we wish to allow for non-alphanumeric characters as input for those fields, can we group them together as planned enhancement of allowing non-alphanumeric characters for string inputs for those fields?

I think the main issue is with how git handles revert.

In Git, when a branch (lets say branch A) is merged into the main repository and then its merge commit is subsequently reverted, any new PR from branch A is seen as having no new changes, and not allowed at all. This is because Git tracks the state of the code rather than individual PRs or branches. 

In your case, branch 2, which reverts all the changes made in branch 1, is merged. Thus, Git recognizes that the changes from branch 1 are effectively nullified. And so, the PR for branch 1 is automatically closed by GitHub because, from Git's perspective, its changes are already accounted for in the main branch through the merge and revert process of branch 2. 

To avoid this, you can use git reset instead of git revert, as it alters the commit history differently. [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-difference-between-git-revert-checkout-and-reset/) is more info on the behaviours of reset and revert.

>     * Does the user needs to enter such a value during normal usage of the app?

The field is for keeping track of internship application deadlines. But we do allow for entries in the past for record keeping. So realistically, the user won't ever have to enter the year 0000, unless they were interning under [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus).

>     * What's the problem if the user entered such a value, on purpose or by mistake?

The app allows it as a valid application deadline. But in our planned enhancements we mentioned that we will warn users if they enter a deadline in the past.

IMO, this cannot be a `severity.VeryLow` as the requirements for that are "purely cosmetic issues" **and** "doesn't affect usage".

The team I tested uses some UML diagrams with excessive infomation and unreadable font sizes in different places. As the course website suggests, I report the different UML diagrams in separate issues with severity.VeryLow, since fixing one of them does not fix the others.

However, in the response session, they mark these as duplicate of an overarching issue, which contains all the problems and with severity.VeryLow. I don't think this follows the description on course website. Duplicate similar problems in different places should be reported separately. If they want to combine the problems, they should increase the severity. Not to mention the total number of problems does not reach the bar of 5.

In this case, for the separate issues I submit, should I reject the marking as duplicate or should I increase the severity?

Solving the overarching issue solves the separate issues, because that tester simply combine all the problems into one. But it has the wrong severity type and it is not submitted by me. In fact, it should not be submitted at all. May I confirm is it still allowed to reject the duplicate?

Suppose in a sequence diagram, a call was made on a method `foo(int a, int b)` that takes in two parameters. But the sequence diagram labels it as a call to `foo()`. Can we justify the omission of the parameters as a means of simplifying the diagram? Or is it just wrong?

According to the email blast on tP submission file names, we should:

> Fixed the issue with `git config --global core.autocrlf true`. Alternatively, you can set the git config locally in the `.git` folder for the project.

I'm not very bright so please bear with my clarification.

Do you mean that if every team member applies `git config --global core.autocrlf true` in their local machine, then the team should no longer face conflicts arising due to line ending representations across different operating systems?

The is the default `.gitignore` from the forked repo:

So only `text-ui-test/ACTUAL.TXT` and `text-ui-test/EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT` are untracked by Git.

In order words, your testing input file `text-ui-test/input.txt` and the expected output file `text-ui-test/EXPECTED.TXT` will still be tracked and can be committed 😄

# Project: Staff-Snap

> ***Craigton Lian's*** *Project Portfolio Page*<br>

### Overview<hr>
Staff-Snap is a desktop HR management application used for managing employees. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> 10 kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions<hr>

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *``{``mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature``}``*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): 
      [\#31](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/31), 
      [\#32](), 
      [\#19](), 
      [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: 
      [\#2](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/2), 
      [\#121](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/121), 
      [\#158](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/158),

  * <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

Excellent detective work @tlylt ! 

Is there any way we can check if the markbind action will go through error-free before merging the PR? I feel like even though I can see a preview of the markdown file in my IDE during editing, it doesn't always build correctly when shipped to gh-pages. 

Basically, what I'm asking is, is there a way to check how the MarkBind will render before I merge the PR?

Another possibility (if you want the pretty green tick) is you can go to your Organisation's CodeCov page at https://app.codecov.io/account/gh/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/yaml and lower the passing threshold for codecov/project and codecov/patch.

Global YAML:
```
coverage:
  status:
    project:
      default:
        target: auto
        threshold: 5.0
```

This will allow CodeCov to pass the PR if your coverage dropped within 5% from the base commit. But do monitor the code coverage so you can ensure good overall coverage 😄

I think the `page-nav` menu that gets embedded in the print file only includes up to level 3 headers. So if you prefer for the deeper nested headers to be included in the ToC, might have to go down the manual ToC route. 

I tried editing the `site.json` to include more header levels but could not get it to work.

It seems that you are just trying to test a constructor, instead of testing whether the instance created fulfills any requirements. Test cases like this can only have bugs when Bar is an abstract class, its constructor is private, etc. I think before testing we can ask ourselves "What are we testing for ?", Is it just to check whether that constructor correctly creates that instance for you or any other requirements?

1. Our team received bug of [one planned enhancement containing multiple distinct enhancements](https://catcher-org.github.io/CATcher/phaseTeamResponse/issues/339). It quotes the requirement on website:

`FAQ: Enhancement X and Y are very similar. Can we count them as one? Answer: Only if adding one automatically adds the other. If one can be added without the other, they are counted as two enhancements.`

And stated that **changing font sizes at two different parts in UI** should be considered as 2 separate enhancements. We think it over-interpretting what's stated in FAQ, as it would lead to situation like adding or modifying a whole feature can be considered as 1 enhancement but the tiny change here is considered as 2 enhancements, which doesn't make sense.

Thus, may I clarify that as long as the enhancement is aimed to achievement the same purpose, even if it changes multiple lines of code in one Java file, **such as changing styles in CSS file, or fixing all grammar and inconsistent error messages in one file `Message.java`**,  it could be considered as 1 enhancement?

2. It is [previously answered in forum](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/475) that 

`If the team has exceeded the allowed count in the planned enhancements, only the first N items (where N is team size x 2) in that list will have immunity. The rest can be reported as bugs. In addition, exceeding the count can be reported as a separate DG bug.`

If there are still vacancies in our planned enhancement, could we reject the issue regarding issues like [one planned enhancement containing multiple distinct enhancements](https://catcher-org.github.io/CATcher/phaseTeamResponse/issues/339)? Because it should not be considered as a bug since we don't exceed the allowed count.

1. In (a) can we show the dependency from Section to Handout even if there's an association between them? Since textbook mentioned "we need not show that as a dependency arrow in the class diagram if the association is already indicated in the diagram", but here the navigability is from Handout to Section so drawing the dash line from Section to Handout does add extra value?

Hi, sorry for the late question - my group and I were confused if we could make fixes to some of these bugs after checking the forums, so we wanted to clarify for these:

1. Our program does not show an error message if no fields have been modified during an `edit` command, and just tells the user that the field has been successfully modified. Would it be a bug fix if we made this case show an error message to reduce confusion?
2. Our program currently has a panel that retains a snapshot of the `Person` data on the UI. Currently, if the user tries to add a person with no changes that already exists on this panel, no error is thrown, and the program tells the user that the person has been successfully added. Would it be a bug fix if we made this case show an error message to reduce confusion?
3. For the panel that retains a snapshot, our intention was to have the snapshot update any existing persons to the latest version of the `Person` data if we add duplicates to this panel. However, it currently does not do this. Will we be allowed to modify this behavior to add this to the program?
4. Are we allowed to modify user input to force upper-case if we had previously specified that the item is unique? ie we want ID to be unique, but both 873B and 873b are allowed when they shouldn't.
5. We have an undo command - however, undo on delete currently returns the person back to the bottom of the list instead of their original location on the list. Will we be allowed to return the person back to their original location?

Finally, I want to ask - our group has made changes that we thought were bug fixes, but realized later that they were enhancements after checking the forums. Can we push new commits to revert these changes by removing them to fix this?

@JasonRay You need to add the `@FXML` labels to `dialog` and `displayPicture` - otherwise your FXML files will not be able to detect the variables.

You can see this from your error message - its leading you to line 41 with a `NullPointerException` - you are calling `setText` on an uninitialized label, so it's not automatically loading in from the FXML file.

> The 2 fields dialog and displayPicture were used, but the corresponding field declarations at the top was not highlighted purple, meaning it is not used

Regarding this, the IDE doesn't seem to detect variable usage in FXML files, even with the `@FXML` tag - don't be too alarmed by this.

Hey @zacwong2151, I believe you can use the path `./data/duke.txt` to fix this issue - the IDE runs the program as if the `ip` folder is the root.

On a side note, you can look into the `java.nio.file.Paths` library - in particular, the `Paths.get` method can generate a relative path that is usable across different OS platforms, without having to deal with the file separators.

OK, so it seems like this was a Java version issue - the Mac that this was tested on was not the one given in the advisory, and due to some miscommunication, we had thought that changing the version did not fix the issue when it in fact it had fixed it.

One interesting thing that had arose here though was that the tester was using Java Launcher to test the jar files - from what I can see Java Launcher could only test 1 of the 3 jar files she was supplied with from different iP projects, but the other 2 jar files could only be launched without error from the terminal using `java -jar nameOfJar.jar`.

The only major difference I could see in the build.gradle files for that jar file compared to the other 2 was the inclusion of the `checkstyle` module (possibly related to [this](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1729226821)). The 2 jar files that failed to run had the `checkstyle` module configured while the 1 that ran did not have it at all.

While the errors have been resolved, I would still appreciate if additional people could test if they can open the program on Mac to confirm if the program can run on the OS.

I am part of @WeeeHung's team, and I wanted to update that we have been rerunning CI a few times already, and only the runner on macOS seems to encounter this issue. The error was always caused by a `JsonMappingException` from the `fasterxml` library, but we are unable to trace the error as we can't access the error log on the runner in the workflow.

> can you give an example command and the precise result message? Is it an empty edit command or editing previous value to the same value?

It is editing previous value to the same value ie `edit p/12345` on a person with the phone number `12345`.

It is a panel that stores the results of our previous `find` command that serves as a sticky-note. On its own it is not meant to update its values even if we edit the original value in the list.

Before:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/115881359/c75159ec-7f39-4c55-9464-bb57f63051ae)

After:

What we wanted was when the user tries to add the person to the panel after an `edit`, the value in the panel refreshes to the latest version of the value. However it does not do that right now.

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/115881359/782b24da-099f-4885-86a4-163f3de414e6)
> _(bug fix for point 2 has already been implemented)_

This was intended at v1.3 of the panel - it is stated in the UG that the panel stores the last known values of the people to add to this panel at the time the command was called. However, the feature was not explicitly implemented as we had thought the implementation at v1.3 was sufficient.

You can express it in 3 branches - notice that branch for `b` and `c` are done no matter the result of `a`, so you should place the check after the paths merge again. Something like:

Hi everyone and Prof @damithc, for a similar question like this, but for testing 100% branch and condition coverage respectively, how will one actually go about doing it? 

For `for` loops, there is a condition of `i < s.length()`, do we consider that as a branch/condition? If yes, will that mean a varying number of times of test, and hence cannot be determined?

Hello, may I know what's the reasoning behind why the options 2 and 3 are correct? 

My understanding is that removing the store() method will cause a compile error because Bar is not an abstract class, which makes the option correct. 

However, by the same logic, will removing process() method not also cause a compile error? 

Could someone help to clarify any misunderstandings I have, as well as to provide an explanation for the 2 options?

Hi Prof @damithc, I have a few questions to clarify. 

1. The team has rejected my feature flaw issue, with the justification that it is the user's fault on the typo and they should fix it themselves based on the error message, in which the error message is correct. However, I believe that the app could do a simple fix to improve the user's experience. How should I go about justifying my disagreement to their rejection? If I would like to argue for NotInScope, do I have to suggest an implementation because the textbook states this: 
     > if the feature is implemented to work in a certain way but it could have been implemented to work in a better way (from the end-user's point of view) without much additional effort


   Does a feature flaw issue means that I have to make sure that this NotInScope change will not lead to more ambiguous issues, even though it fixes one of the many ambiguous issues, like white spaces trimming? I can anticipate some further debates on how trying to fix this feature flaw could give rise to even more ambiguous issues, but it is not stated in the justification of the dev team, so will the final evaluation of the prof and ta consider these aspects?


2. The team has also rejected another issue and marked as duplicate, but I realised it could have been a functionality bug instead of a feature flaw, which the dev team did not change the type. In this case, if I were to disagree with the rejection, should I justify based on which type? Will I be penalised if I talk about functionality bug instead? 

3. According to this [forum](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/499) on duplicates, as long as the fixes are independent like of different paragraphs, they are not considered duplicates, because changing the format at one place doesn't fix the other one.

    Could I just further clarify if the example below could be considered as **non-duplicates** even though the team has marked it as NotInScope, if I report both use case 2 and use case 3 as separate format issues?

```
Use Case 1
1. .... 
2. ... 
   Use case ends. 

Use Case 2
1. .... 
2. ... Use case ends.
 
Use Case 3
1. .... 
2. ... Use case ends.
```
 
4. Can I clarify what it means by describing UI in use case? For example, if we state `App shows the error message`,  is that considered giving Ui details, and hence incorrect? Is the more appropriate and correct way `App detects an error in the input`?
</panel>

<panel  header="**4. :fas-info-circle: Queries on duplicate**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/499" expanded>


Hi Prof @damithc, could I clarify what exactly constitutes duplicates? 

According to the website, it is mentioned that if the bugs can't be fixed independently, then it is not considered a duplicate. 
<img width="578" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-19 at 6 17 53 PM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/47603827/e2970703-560d-41ef-81c2-025268713193">



Does that mean that for documentation bugs, like UG and DG, if the same formatting issues appear in multiple places, but are reported as individual bugs (e.g. there are 3 individual incorrect format issues), they should not be considered as duplicates, since fixing the issue at one paragraph, does not fix the issue at the next paragraph?

Hi Prof @damithc, I would like to clarify whether for PE Phase II, will commenting on feature flaws of the app's implementation based solely on the UG be allowed? Or is it best to do so in Phase I?

<panel  header="**6. :fas-info-circle: Error message for Add Command**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/396" expanded>


Hi, our team would like to check if our current implementation might be deemed as a bug and/or feature flaw. 

Currently, our implementation for Add Command checks whether all prefixes are valid, before checking for duplicate prefixes. For example, if there's a duplicate `n/` prefix, but a missing compulsory prefix `d/`, the error message will be showing invalid command format. 

As such, the duplicate prefix check will never be called if compulsory prefixes are absent even though there are duplicate prefixes.

Our team's stance is that it is neither a bug nor a feature flaw, because it is indeed true that with a missing compulsory prefix, it is an invalid command format. Hence, we would like to seek a 2nd opinion on this matter.

Hi, our team will like to check if we are able to edit the error message for our Clear Command, as the current error message shows "Address Book has been cleared", but our app's functionality does not follow an address book currently, since we have changed the context. 

Is this allowed as a bug fix for v1.4 as the current error message is different in functionality from our app? 

Thank you!

Hi, we realised that our app shows an incorrect name as "Address App" in the title. Our product does not have anything to do with addresses, as detailed in our UG as well, which might mislead our users. Hence, we identify it as a bug in our app. 

Can we clarify if we are able to make this change to the title of our app's UI?

Hi, may I know if we would have to take into consideration about the naming of our packages? Currently, everything is under "address" but it's not really relevant anymore since we have changed the name of our address book app. 

If the naming of the packages matters, are we allowed to change it, considering it's a refactor of code in v1.4?

Hi Prof, thank you for your replies. Allow me to clarify some of the comments further: 

> In your response, you can admit you chose the wrong type in the original bug, propose a different type, and justify why the bug should be accepted under the new type.

How will this affect the accuracy of the tester? 

> `App shows the error message` -&gt; Borderline, but still acceptable

Does this mean that the team's rejection is valid, even though it's is borderline? 


Also, according to the website, 
> You may report grammar issues as bugs but note that minor grammar issues that don't hinder the reader are allowed to be categorized as response.NotInScope. 

Does that mean that all documentation bugs that don't hinder readers can be NotInScope? Some examples are missing punctuations for sentences, and inconsistent format.

In my code, I created the Duke object so that the taskList.Answer() will be run. And that seems to be the root of the problem. Thank you for the helpful tips!

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Addressing Functionality Bugs under Planned Enhancements**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/524" expanded>


Hello!

I recently reviewed a team in PE and noticed some functionality bugs, specifically a non-responsive command when a parameter is missing. The team has listed this issue under planned enhancements. However, according to the textbook, planned enhancements are typically meant for addressing feature flaws, not for addressing functionality bugs. 

I'm a bit confused about whether covering a functionality bug under planned enhancements grants immunity from bug reports. With this understanding, I submitted a bug report, assuming that the planned enhancement does not exempt them from addressing the bug. However, the team marked my report as `NotInScope`. 

Could someone clarify if my bug report was appropriate in this context? And if so, was it correct for the team to classify it as `NotInScope`?

Thank you!

If you are proposing to _merge_ the CI-failing PRs first so that the problematic code becomes available in the main code base for others to fix the CI problems, this decision is up to your team.

In such cases, can we merge the pull request to another branch of the team repo, and later merge the branch back to the master of the team repo? Will the contributions of all members be correctly tracked and credited?

This is interesting. It seems like it doesn't fall into the 'bug' category since it doesn't differ from the advertised behavior, nor does it fit into the 'feature change' category since there is no workaround. Let's see what the professor will say.

Relative path is the location of the file relative to the working directory while absolute relative is location from the root directory. Based on @WZWren reply, you can also trace back after generating the relative file path to have a better understanding of how it works

I personally have a tester that tried it in PED and I feel that it is a gray area, that because in PE there no explicit instruction that one terminal only is allowed, hence users can try it and open multiple terminals and call it a bug that basically free to take from most groups. However, I believe that it should be in not in scope, what do the others think about this issue.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Missing CS2101 context when testing documentation**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/530" expanded>

I am exempted from CS2101, and thus am taking CS2103 standalone. My tutorial mates and I have never taken the former course and do not have access to its materials. Thus I have not heard about the goings-on in that course; I have no context as to the additional requirements that it turns out CS2101 places on this course's documentation, such as the UG.

Still, I was assigned to test the product of a team whose documentation has to fulfill both courses' rubrics. I was thus missing important context under which some of that team's documentation was written and _phrased_ (e.g. tone), and the reasons behind why they may have made certain decisions that differ from that of the teams I have seen so far.

It is only now that my assigned team has responded, including content such as screenshots, files, and keywords that I am finding out/hearing about for the first time, that I am learning of this difference. This has negatively impacted my report accuracy, especially since I was only able to make mainly documentation-related reports for their product for lack of other types of issues found. Had I known some of this information beforehand, I would have made my reports differently/made different reports altogether.

Will any of this be taken into account when it comes to grading for accuracy? I feel like this would not have been a concern had the team assignment been done amongst teams who are also not taking CS2101.

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Is team member count factored into project grading?**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/461" expanded>

[Part 2B of the TP grading page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-grading.html#2-project-grading-implementation-15-marks) mentions that effort for the entire project gets evaluated by both testers (peers) and tutors.

On average, the percentage of total effort in comparison to AB3 that a team with less members would be able to put in would be lower than that of a team with more members, if all members are aiming to put in an IP's worth of effort. Therefore, a team with less members may get a lower effort score from testers and/or tutors, especially if the tester has a different frame of reference from being in a team with more members.

Will such a lower effort score get "re-weighted" to account for teams with less members? For reference, I am in a tutorial with only 4 people total, so we automatically formed a team of 4.

AB3 came with 6 separate, extra pages linked in the DG. These are the setup/getting started, documentation, logging, testing, configuration & devops pages.

The grading details on the course website state:

> The main content you add should be in the `docs/DeveloperGuide.md` file (for ease of tracking by grading scripts).

Our changes to the product render some of these extra pages outdated. We have also already made some updates to these pages. Additionally, some of these pages are rather short as is (like the configuration page).

May I know what a good way to handle these extra pages would be? Some potential options I could think of:

- Make minimal updates to the pages such that they aren't outdated
- Or flesh out the content of the pages
- Or scrap the pages entirely
- Or merge the pages into the DG (presumably to ensure they count for grading)
- etc.

There are also the tutorials that we used to familiarise with AB3, but we have already scrapped those.

About the JavaFX warning, I get it too. My SceneBuilder app seems to save FXMLs in V20.0.1 even if I manually change the version in the raw file and reload. For me, my warning says my JavaFX runtime is `17-internal`. I hope it will be fine. I [searched it up a bit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65991076/11536796), so maybe I can look into that for the TP.

Thank you for the quick response. Our team doesn't really have a specific tool in mind at the moment, and I was just curious to know what our full options were. To avoid complications, I suppose we will stick with the two tools specified.

We seem impartial towards them both. Are there any recommendations for which tool to choose? Perhaps one has historically been more popular than the other among teams?

I also located this mention in the week 10 schedule:

> You are discouraged from moving sections currently in `DeveloperGuide.md` to additional markdown files. Reasons: 1. You need to submit the DG as a single PDF file at the end of the semester. 2. When checking DG-related tP increments, we only check your contributions to that file.

Just to clarify, do **all** our issues (and issues associated to milestones) have to conform to the user story format, instead of just the user story specific ones?

If, let's say, we are working on a specific implementation that does not directly pertain to any single user story but is in itself a pre-requisite for the feature specified in the user story (and other relevant user stories) to be developed, can we create issues like `Storage: Fix persistence bug` or our own format, then assign those issues to the version milestones to better track and document our team's progress? This way, even if a user story or a feature specified has multiple components, each part can be assigned to different members, PRs, and issues so we can more easily evaluate our own progress.

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Issue with merging branch-level-8**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/93" expanded>

Hi, I was looking at the iP progress dashboard and realized that my branch-level-8 was not registered by the script:

<img width="883" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/19762596/e3cbea51-ed14-47d0-851c-8e9e8f82760c">

I suspect that the reason is because I made a mistake in merging that branch to my master branch earlier on, and didn't actually merge that branch to my master branch but instead I accidentally copied those changes over. (i.e. I have completed Level-8 but I did so on the master branch, so all my relevant code is on the master branch).

<img width="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/19762596/5d68902f-e47f-4882-943f-ca331cae7b40">

Is there any way I can rectify this? I'm hesitant to merge the old branch-level-8 with my current master branch as I don't want my code to be messed up, is there any safe way to do so without the merge commit affecting my current code base?

On macOS, JDK versions are permanently installed in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines. You need to `cd` into that directory and `sudo rm -rf` that particular version of Java. The Application Support directory contains Java itself (the Application to support the running of Java apps on macOS), which (iirc) is different from JDK (the Java Development Kit used to compile and run Java code).

The instructions [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html) are clearer.

@lunaroddity I can't tell from your screenshots, but if you entered the command "bye", and only then received the build success message, then that means the gradle run was successful. However, if the program exited immediately, then that might be an issue, as in my case the program only indicated the success message after I input the "bye" command. In fact, the program ran normally for every command until I input the "bye" command.

@D-Limiter I had the same issue on macOS, I tried `./gradlew shadowJar` without the `clean` option and it worked afterwards, although I'm not sure why, maybe you can try that. Additionally, you could also try running the shadowJar command from Gradle in IntelliJ instead of the command line.

Hey, I would like to suggest trying out the [second method](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle). 
I could not set up JavaFX properly with the first method too but this one worked for me! I tweaked the steps a little to make it work for my project and the import statements (finally) got recognized :)

Setup steps(some steps are slightly different since the version of JavaFX that the tutorial uses is JavaFX 17.0.7):
1. In your build.gradle file, add the following to your `build.gradle` file on top of your existing plugins:
(this adds the JavaFX plugin for Gradle)
```
plugins ``{``
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
``}``
```
2. In your `build.gradle` file, also add the following:
(the snippet below specifies that JavaFX 17.0.7 should be used, and that we need the 'javafx.controls' & 'javafx.fxml' modules, FXML can be omitted if you do not plan to use FXML to develop your chatbot GUI)
```
javafx ``{``
    version = "17.0.7"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
``}``
```
3. Run your `build.gradle` file:
- Linux/Mac: `./gradlew run`
- Windows: `gradlew run`

Really hope this helps! Jiayous!

&hat;The above is mine. Seems like that might be the issue since it looks like there are only distributions for mac OS but not other OSes. However, my build.gradle file does not have what you have since I used the second method to do set up JavaFX. Adding your recommended dependencies breaks my checkstyle file.

Ok thanks prof. I have taken these steps so far:
- Revert all traces of the second step by removing the JavaFX SDK and updating build.gradle to the first method
- loaded gradle changes
- ran: ./gradlew build
- Managed to get the project structure to the state that @AlagappanRa described:

- However, this change breaks the following:
- The checkstyle: It seems to completely ignore the existence of the main file but somehow can run checks on the test file:

Hi Delton, I think you can refer to the additions to the build.gradle file that @AlagappanRa mentioned [above](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1728708305). I have fixed several issues related to the somewhat emotionally motivated [post](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1728126734) that I had made regarding reverting back to the first version so I'll be sharing more about how I fixed it in the next post.

Thanks @AlagappanRa :)

As for the checkstyle breaking, it turns out that I did not delete the module-info.java file from my repo, which is required for the first method of installing but not the second. So if anyone is reverting to the first method of including JavaFX, you might want to follow the steps below for reverting to the first method:
- Remove any JavaFX SDKs that you might have installed for the second method(delete it from whereever that you might have placed the JavaFX SDK in when you first set up JavaFX)
- Remove these lines that you had to add for the second method from your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
javafx ``{``
    version = "17.0.7"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
``}``
```
- Delete any module-info.java files(not needed for including JavaFX using the first method)
- Include these lines in your dependencies file(credits: @AlagappanRa):
```gradle
dependencies ``{``
    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for macOS on ARM64
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:mac-aarch64' 

    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for Linux
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:linux'

    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for Windows
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:win'
``}``
```
- note: what the above lines do is to include distributions for other OSes(as described in the comments), so the resulting jar file generated will be cross-platform(I have yet to try it out on other OSes but I will keep everyone posted)
- Next, run `./gradlew build` in order to set up the project dependencies to include the required JavaFX components in your project
- Verify that the dependencies have been added by going to `File -&gt; Project Structure -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Modules -&gt; Dependencies`. You should see the below:

- Ensure your ip still works by running your ip as per usual
- Ensure that your checkstyle still works after making the above changes(if applicable)

**Update: The jar file works on multiple platforms**

TL:DR - Ensure the following:
- Correct JDK version(especially for mac users)
- `build.gradle` for the javaFX components is configured correctly
- If reverting from the second version of setting up JavaFX to the first, ensure that all traces of the second method are deleted(e.g. the JavaFX JDK & `module-info.java`)
- JavaFX dependencies are present in the project structure

Last but not least, I would like to thank everyone for their help in helping me to resolve these issues!! :))

Please correct me if I am wrong!

I believe the diagram is largely correct. But I believe that it is not exactly consistent with what was taught in CS2103T

Correct aspects:
- The &lt;\&lt;class>\> stereotype for the FastFoodTerminal is correct, assuming that TurnOn() is a class-level method of FastFoodTerminal.
- The classes invloved are drawn correctly, assuming the DoYouHaveCheeseBurger() method is class-level as well

Incorrect aspects:
- Uneccessary &lt;\&lt;static>\> stereotype; The &lt;\&lt;class>\> stereotype tagged to the FastFoodTerminal class already suggests that TurnOn() is a class-level method of FastFoodTerminal
- Answer = ... seems uneccessary. I feel that you only need to write the method call (e.g. in this example, just writing DoYouHaveCheeseBurger() would suffice in the example that you attached;

> Q1(a) How did you know that `heading` is a package private visibility?


`heading` does not have any access modifier. In Java, any field without an access modifier is package-private by default as per the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html).

Here is a screenshot of the relevant portion of the `Handout` class for easier reference:

<img width="443" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-28 at 6 00 35 PM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/66860275/adcdf777-0627-43c5-9f9d-3761f0edaedb">


> Q1(b) Instead of 2 arrows, mine is drawn as composition (similar to 1(a)). I also added 2 more reference (dotted) arrows from each Section object to the Handout object 


I think I should have added those for more detail. Thanks for pointing that out!

> Q1(c) I did not have an [else] condition in my `alt` box. Other than that, my diagram is similar

I think omitting the `[else]` is acceptable in activity diagrams. Page 155 of the textbook does mention this:
<img width="495" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-28 at 5 59 10 PM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/66860275/74a27e41-b475-4af7-9b29-406c2e071e85">

> For the activity diagram question, I agree with @TeeRenJing 's implementation of the if-else portion. I think it makes more sense to have 3 different cases:
> 
> 1. Where p1, p2 and p3 are all positive,
> 2. There are 3 consecutive failures, and
> 3. Else
> 
> However, I also added a box containing "user prompted to place hand again" to the else line. I feel like @kiwibang 's way of representing the if-else statements is inaccurate. According to his diagram, 3 failures causes the user to be prompted to place their hand again, followed by the door being disabled, which doesn't make sense.
> 

Yep, agreed. Mine seems to be rather convoluted and perhaps wrong. 

> With regards to the sequence diagram, within the `[alt]` block, I believe an empty `[else]` block is necessary. To my understanding, inside the `[alt]` block, exactly one scenario has to be chosen.

Agreed, I feel that there should be an empty else block to handle the scenarios where status is neither 2 nor 3.

Thanks for the valuable inputs! 👍

@ktzy0305 I have some questions regarding some parts of your diagram. Could you help to clarify them? TIA!

(a) 
- For the association between `Brochure` and `Handout`, should it be 2 arrows instead? I feel that this association is not bi-directional but rather 2 uni-directional associations. Not very sure though
- For the dependency from `Section` to `Handout`, do we need to draw this? The notes say that if there is already an association between the two classes, then the dependency arrow is redundant and thus can be omitted. However, the association between the `Section` to `Handout` is in a different direction. In such a case, do we have to draw the dependency arrow like your diagram and mine, or can we omit it? 

(b)
- Do we need to show the composition relationship in an object diagram? Or can that be omitted? 
- Is there a strict rule as to whether we can give names to unamed objects?

(c) 
- Is there supposed to be a self-invocation in the activation bar for your `pad` method? Since the `pad` method calls the `increase` method, both of which are methods of the same `Factory` class

(d) 
- Perhaps the corners of each activity can be rounded more? It seems to be a little pointy

Other than that, I see no issues! These are really nicely drawn diagrams that I could never hope to achieve! 👍

I think for this situation, just add a comment near the change or add documentation near the change, like for gradle, add a comment in the gradle file or even in the Duke file, just signalling that its a dummy commit and you've carried out the increment in a previous commit so you have some proof when it comes to grading. Shouldn't be an issue as pointed out by prof above but if you're apprehensive haha. And add a tag to the dummy commit, so the code gets recorded.

I appreciate the thoughtful discussion on whether to have a separate Storage class in our project. I'd like to share some strengths and advantages of having a dedicated Storage class, despite the tight coupling with TaskList that we've observed:

1. Isolation of Saving/Writing Operations:

One of the key benefits of introducing a Storage class is that it provides a clear separation of concerns. It isolates the task of saving and writing data from the rest of the application logic. This separation makes our codebase more maintainable and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), a fundamental principle in software design.
By encapsulating file I/O operations within the Storage class, we reduce the risk of scattering file-related code throughout the TaskList class. This isolation can help us manage and debug these operations more effectively.

2. Error Handling and Abstraction:

Another advantage of having a Storage class is the opportunity it provides for centralized error handling and abstraction. We can implement error-checking and exception handling in one place within the Storage class, ensuring that any issues related to data storage are handled consistently.
Furthermore, as pointed out by another participant. if we decide to support different data storage formats or locations in the future, the Storage class can serve as an abstraction layer. This allows us to change the underlying storage mechanisms without affecting the TaskList class or other parts of our application. It promotes flexibility and future-proofing.

3. Code Organization and Readability:

From a code organization perspective, having a Storage class can improve the overall readability of our code. It abstracts away low-level file operations and provides a more human-readable interface for saving and loading data. This can make the code within the TaskList class cleaner and easier to understand. 

4. Potential for Future Features:

While our project may not currently have additional data storage needs beyond the TaskList, designing a Storage class can set a foundation for future features. If we ever need to manage other data files alongside the task list, having a dedicated Storage class will make it easier to extend our codebase without introducing unnecessary complexity. Also helps to facilitate reading of same file to multiple task lists and vice versa, helping with versions of files and tasks list.

Feedback/Question/Open to Discussion: Given that the tP is also a breadth first approach, and we should aim to produce a working product at every version. Shouldn't it be a requirement to have the appropriate level of codecov throughout the versions, rather than delaying it to v1.4. I understand it may be because of the feature freeze process in v1.3 but it inadverdently still leads to piling up of the burden of testing and coverage to the last 10 days between v1.3 and v1.4.

Yes, both the UG and DG submissions for v1.3 are draft submissions. The final submissions are due later, along with the v1.4. Although for the purpose of PE-Dry Run, teams should try to ensure that their UG is as close to expected behaviour so that the testing team can test appropriately.

Thanks for the advise Prof.

For reference, I am using a macOS and this is the second time that I have tried pushing changes to my gitHub fork. It worked well for the purpose of week 2's ip but am unable to push any of the commits for week 3's iP tasks due to this authentication error. really unsure on how to proceed and submit my work for week 3's tasks. 

Any advise would be greatly appreciated!

I agree with @kokrui, we can also dedicate a separate `txt` file for when we run `runtest.sh` (and purging it before every run). What I did was to allow `Duke` to access different files via different pathnames. 

I've also noticed that the relative pathnames resolve differently in `Duke.java` and when we use `runtest.sh`.

Hey, I think you should modify your ~`.sh` script~ code to also create `data/duke.txt` if it doesn't exist.

Edit: It should be done in the java code instead, you might also want to reset the file to blank state before each run of the test.

Hey, with `package duke / package duke.exceptions` as you've mentioned and your project structure, what worked for me was to mark `src/main/java` as your Sources Root directory. This way the packages are identified relative to it.

3. When running Duke.java, get error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application. <br/><br/>

In either way, does anyone has a solution for this? 🙁

@woojiahao 

Thanks for your help! I believe I have had both Java 11 and Java 17 installed previously.

My particular error: 
Files executed successfully if SDK under Project Structure is 17. Since this project requires Java 11, I tried switching SDK to 11 but when running Duke.java, error occurs. 

My steps of resolving the error:
1. File -&gt; Project Structure -&gt; SDK (choose 11) -&gt; Language Level (choose Default) -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK. (https://www.baeldung.com/intellij-change-java-version from CS2040S setup / @woojiahao )

2. IntelliJ IDEA (beside File) -&gt; Build, Execution, Deployment -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Java Compiler -&gt; Project bytecode version (set to 11) -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK. (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67098514/java-error-release-version-17-not-supported)

3. Build (same menu bar as File and IntelliJ IDEA) -&gt; Rebuild Project.

4. Run Duke.java. Should run successfully.

Hi @s-peiran. 
My steps are:
1. Create a branch base on the content of master.
2. Make edits on branch.
3. Commit changes to branch.
4. Merge branch into master. (I guess you've missed this and hence your master is not up to date with branch 7?)
5. Make tag for this comit.
6. Push master, new branch, and all tags. (When you click the Push in Sourcetree, you need to check the checkboxes of master and the branch, and also  the push all tags.
7. Repeat the steps for next task.

I spotted that you've merge master into branch 7 which might cause a bit problem -- you're updating branch 7 but not master.

From the examples given, the terms are related to the project itself rather than general terminology.

I think that your bot should check if the file exists, if it does it should load that file at the start to show the previous tasks, if it does not it can create the file and maybe tell the user that it has created a file. Then after each command, it updates the file accordingly.

Hi @TiwKangXu ,

I agree with @geraldngjx that I think the issue leading to this error might be that your main class name in build.gradle and your actual package name in your code.

For me, my Duke.java is located such that: src > main > java > duke > Duke.java. Therefore, my build.gradle looks like:

application ``{``
mainClass.set("duke.Duke")
``}``

You can just clean your build using gradle and rename your mainClass or package name to make them consistent, before repeating the steps for A-Jar using gradle.

My GUI looks pretty much like the one in the JavaFX tutorial except that I chaged the images for Duke and the User. For anyone who had troubles with their text becoming an ellipsis in the dialog box, you can remove the prefHeight in the VBox in the MainWindow.fxml

Originally search command allowed for multiple names, but was changed to 1 name. Though it was not explicitly stated in v1.3 that you could search for multiple names, searching for multiple names always returned no users anyway.

For example, previously `search Alex Yeoh, Irfan Ibrahim` was a valid search, but would return nothing. 

Documentation states that if multiple conditions were given, then it would return users that would match all, i.e. have both names. Since this would always return nothing, would it violate the feature freeze to instead throw an error instead of return nothing?

Sorry if this is a last minute question, but I realised I did not use FXML as I found it more intuitive to add different UI elements with JavaFX on its own. I was wondering if this would get me penalised under making a GUI at least as good as the original.

From website:

Q. How are the iP git tags used in grading?

A. Adding a git tag in the iP is a self-declaration that you think you are done with the iP increment. We take your word for it. We don't check the code to see if you have actually done the said increment. Therefore, it is just a mechanism for you to self-declare progress and for us to monitor those progress declarations.

So I think you can just change it at the Level-5 commit onwards

The problem still existed after making it into its own function, but the issue seemed to be a problem with the gradle? Rebuilding it through gradle (instead of using IntelliJ) seemed to fix it for now...

Hi Prof, are we allowed to update the AddressBook icon with our own icon during feature freeze?

Previously, my linus.jar has failed the automated smoke test due to differences in Java version (19 and 11).

On Windows, using Java 11, for the linus.jar uploaded on 09-20-2023 (MM-DD-YYYY) at 20:56:29:

After removing Java 19 and installing Java 11, I created a new linus.jar file that runs well on my machine(Windows). However, I am unsure if it really is compiled under Java 11, nor its compatibility with Linux and MacOS. Would really appreciate if anyone running Linux/MacOS could help me do a smoke test!

Hi guys, I'm facing some issue with locating my duke.txt file which is located in my data directory. I am searching for this file from multiple classes in my duke package, such as my `Duke.java` class. And yet when I run my code, I get the error 

```..\..\..\..\data\duke.txt (The system cannot find the path specified)```

Anyone has any idea why this happens? Is there an issue with my relative pathing? Attached below is my file directory and my `Duke.java` file
I previously used the absolute path `data/duke.txt` which worked, and now I face this issue when I try to change to relative paths.

Any help is much appreciated!

I am confused regarding how to implement assertions for Week 5 project. Are we supposed to run Duke.main()? Because earlier in Week 4 - Project, this was mentioned:

``` Note that you no longer need to keep the text-based UI after adding a GUI. Similarly, there is no need to use the I/O redirection style automated testing anymore (that technique is suited for text UIs only). ```

So do we still have to maintain our text-based UI on top of our GUI chatbot? Because from my understanding, assertions are only relevant when you run Duke.main, and are not relevant when you run the GUI chatbot. I ask this because I get this error when I try to run Duke.main ```JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application```, and so I'm wondering if I need to fix this or simply remove everything that is not related to running the GUI chatbot

Thanks all for replies! The issue was that the working directory where my main method was run from was different from where my runtest.bat was run from, so when I tried to run runtest.bat there were issues due to the wrong relative pathing. Fixed it by running runtest.bat from the IP directory instead of the text-ui-test directory, but because of this had to change certain parts of runtest.bat to point to the correct ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT

I agree with @woojiahao about ensuring that `Bar` is properly unit tested separately. One example I can think of is if `Bar` is a `String` so `fooMethod()` will return a `String`. It wouldn't make sense to test how the `String` is being created but rather just assume that its being created correctly. If theres anything wrong with the `String` class creation, it should be caught by the `String` classes unit tests (which i'm sure the people creating the standard Java library have done so).

Hi,

I refer to #510. In #510 , the poster says that inserting a `null` value in the data file causes the app to **crash**.

Prof @damithc responded by saying that the app only needs to support what is specified in the AB3 User Guide, with the following screenshot:

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/110604064/49f325bc-6a9e-4c26-90ed-b8be5bb1e8dd)

He then goes on to say:

> Recovering from improper edits to the data file (or other config files) was not an expectations at v1.4, unless you specifically stated such a feature in the UG.

However, there is a misalignment between the AB3 User Guide and the behaviour of the poster's program (btw, I was not a tester for this poster, I am asking a more general question).

According to the AB3 User Guide, should the data file be invalid, the app will be cleared. However, in this case, the app completely crashes/does not start with an invalid data file. The app does not fail gracefully.

Hence, the 2 statements by Prof seem to contradict. I want to ask about which is correct.

I think the mismatch between user guide and app may confuse real users (again, I know the poster changed their user guide, but I'm speaking more generally).

To give an example, consider the following scenario from AB3:

The user uses tags to store projects they work on together with a given person and the original data file is as follows:
```json
``{``
  "persons" : [ ``{``
    "name" : "Alice Pauline",
    "phone" : "94351253",
    "email" : "alice@example.com",
    "address" : "123, Jurong West Ave 6, #08-111",
    "tags" : [ "projectX", "projectY" ]
  ``}``, ``{``
    "name" : "Benson Meier",
    "phone" : "98765432",
    "email" : "johnd@example.com",
    "address" : "311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25",
    "tags" : [ "projectY", "projectX", "projectZ" ]
  ``}``, ``{``
    "name" : "Carl Kurz",
    "phone" : "95352563",
    "email" : "heinz@example.com",
    "address" : "wall street",
    "tags" : [ "projectX" ]
  ``}``, ``{``
    "name" : "Daniel Meier",
    "phone" : "87652533",
    "email" : "cornelia@example.com",
    "address" : "10th street",
    "tags" : [ "projectX", "projectZ" ]
  ``}``, ``{``
    "name" : "Elle Meyer",
    "phone" : "9482224",
    "email" : "werner@example.com",
    "address" : "michegan ave",
    "tags" : [ "projectY", "projectZ" ]
  ``}``, ``{``
    "name" : "Fiona Kunz",
    "phone" : "9482427",
    "email" : "lydia@example.com",
    "address" : "little tokyo",
    "tags" : [ "projectX" ]
  ``}``, ``{``
    "name" : "George Best",
    "phone" : "9482442",
    "email" : "anna@example.com",
    "address" : "4th street",
    "tags" : [ "projectY", "projectX" ]
  ``}`` ]
``}``
```
Now projectX is over. There is no easy way to remove all projectX tags using the app's functions. The user tries changing the json files directly. They want to use find and replace, but do not know what to replace with because there will sometimes be leftover commas. Hence they do the following:
```
find: "projectX"
replace: null
```
Thinking that it worked, they close the data file and do not try opening the app until a few days later.

A few days later, the user tries running the app, but it cannot start/crashes immediately after starting. It is not obvious to them that the issue arose because they changed the data file a few days prior. Referring to the user guide, there is no indication that anything they do can cause the app not to start, nor is there any troubleshooting offered. Changing the data file should only clear the app at worst, not cause the app to be unable to boot. Hence they do not draw the link between their changing of the data file a few days prior, to the current problem of the app not being able to start.

The user is left confused, thinking the app has stopped working.

Hence, I personally believe that it is a valid bug as it can affect real users and the documentation does not align with the behaviour of the app.

However, after reading Prof @damithc 's response to #510, I am not very sure and hope to seek clarification. Thank you!

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: UI window size bug or enhancement**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/338" expanded>



Hi friends,

My team had previously implemented a feature where we dynamically fixed the minimum window size based on the users' screen resolution. This was done because our app displays quite a lot of data and we didn't want the window size to be too small.

This feature was implemented before the feature freeze and was in our PE-D jar file.

However, after the PE-D, we realised that if the user changes their settings (sets a smaller screen resolution) after launching our app, the app becomes unusable as the minimum window size will become too big. This would violate one of the TP constraints, where the app should be usable on 150% at 1280 x 720.

We found a solution where we can listen for changes in screen resolution and re-set the minimum window size when such an event triggers.

As this issue causes our app to become unusable when it crops up, we think of it as a bug and want to fix it. However, we wanted to confirm that setting an event trigger as described is not considered an enhancement.

Would appreciate guidance on the matter!

Thank you!

Hi, I tested it on my windows laptop. The bye command does not exit the app. Additionally, perhaps because my laptop screen is smaller, the window does not fit on my screen and I can't see the bar to type commands in. If I click somewhere else I can't type anymore. Additionally, I can't see the close button because of the window size and the only way I can exit is to close the command line from which I launched the program. Otherwise, the app seems to work fine.

> Problems caused by extreme user behaviors:
If the problems can only happen in case of deliberate sabotage (e.g., user entered a 30-digit telephone number), in which case it should not be considered a bug.
However, if such input can be entered by a user mistake, they should not cause harm e.g., such mistakes should not crash the app, corrupt the data, or make it unusable.
Problems caused by integer overflows -- apply the guideline in the previous point.

According to the definition of a functional bug, we should follow the above guideline for integer overflow. Currently, this problem occurs when trying to specify the ID that is unique to our Customer or Delivery (Different from AB3 Index). When inputting the maximum integer, the error message specifies that the ID should me more than 0 when clearly it is more than 0. As the error message does not correspond to the incorrect action of the user, can this be considered a functional bug? A user can accidentally input this large integer number by accident.

If it is not possible to fix, would this be possible to be added as a planned enhancement?

Now, we are considering to reset back to the last previous commit where we made the merge. Would this be a better idea to prevent any potential conflict regarding authorship or any other problems that may arise? If we reset it back, would that cause other authorship problems?

After the PE-D, we are trying to fix some bugs but we are unsure if the following would constitute a bug fix or a feature change:

1.	Is it considered an enhancement or a bug fix for missing error messages that we stated in the UG? For example, the error message did not show as the code checking for the error is incorrect.
2.	Similarly, are we able to fix error messages that are thrown wrongly? For example, we threw an invalid command format instead of an error regarding the index if we input the wrong index.
3. Are we able to edit some message clearer ? For example we made a distinction between customer and delivery ID. One of our error message left out “customer” and only stated ID. 
4.	Are we able to adjust the underlying implementation of certain features that does not affect the UI / what the user sees? For example, we want to hash the secret answer stored in the json file as we are not doing that currently.

As long as condition a, condition b and condition c are true, all the three will be executed. They're not an if else statement such that only one path can be taken.

As mentioned before, while it is more convenient for one person to update the entire UG, we recommend that each person updates their own part of the docs so that we can easily track the contribution of each member using RepoSense
```
Due to this statement, our team is unsure whether for every part of the project, do we all have to contribute in some way? We are worried that because we did not contribute to a certain aspect, we would get penalised in some way.  For example, for the README page, do we have to contribute a sentence or two? It wouldn't make sense if all 5 members try to participate by contributing a sentence when there's only a few lines. It'll be more efficient if one person does it.

> @juliusgambe I updated the code dashboard just now. Check if the package renaming has significantly messed up authorship tracking (e.g., almost all code is not attributed to the person who did the package renaming). If the current authorship attributions are more or less OK, you don't have to revert anything. Any small discrepancies in authorship attribution can be fixed using `@@author` tags, as explained [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/tools.html#tool-reposense-for-authorship-tracking).

Thank you for your reply at this hour. Upon looking at the changes in authorship, I think we are deciding to git reset to when the change was made. However, this would cause the merge commits we made so far to be removed if we reset. Thus, we would like to ask if firstly, would this help to revert back the authorship to its original state and also, because some of our PPP code was merged in between, would this affect the hard deadline for the draft PPP?

> @juliusgambe Yes, but only if the current message is strictly incorrect (not 'can be better, more precise, etc.'). After taking another look at your case, I think it should be enough to clearly state in the UG that any index inputs should be 1 .. MAX_INT. As MAX_INT is an extreme input, dealing with it can be postponed, provided such inputs don't cause any _harm_ currently. Sorry I didn't catch it in my earlier reply.

Just to clarify, if we add a definition for what is a *valid ID* which would be  from 1 to MAX_INT in our UG and for any commands that expect an ID,  the ID parameter it should be from 1 to MAX_INT, then for error messages that _currently state_ "ID should be a positive integer" and if we key in a number more than the MAX_INT, 2147483648, and it throws this error message, it would still be incorrect right and we should rectify this? As we are not making it more specific as it is incorrect in the first place.

Unless, the error message states that "ID must be a positive integer and must be a valid ID", then we cannot change this as our UG defines what is a valid ID right? (Which is 1 to MAX_INT)

- Fix multiple prefixes allowed for notePerson issue (For example, notePerson 1 1 r/Likes to dance. r/Likes to swim) - This is an unintended behaviour that can be fixed simply. This does not change how the feature works.
- Incorrect command result output (This is yet again another unintended behaviour that can be fixed easily without changing how the feature works.)
- Fixing unintended behaviour of the command

P.S. The following changes are made based on the fact that the outcome is incorrect or unintended and there are no additional features added or changed. I was wondering due to the gray area between what can and cannot be changed, will we be penalized if we have incorrectly classified certain changes as "bug fixes" but it was actually a "feature change". I have made the following changes already and was wondering if I could push this code to the main repo, hence I hope to seek clarification before doing so. Hope to be able to be advised on this! Thank you.

May I ask if force pushing commits after rebasing to edit previous commit messages allowed? Due to the feedback from the previous automated tP review, I was informed that my commit messages were too long, hence I decided  to edit my commit messages for my current PR since it was not merged (hence this does not affect my team members branch history) but this requires a rebase and a force-push afterwards. Technically, I believe that it is a legitimate method in order to fix commit messages for accuracy (and I had done so with the knowledge that it does not affect my team member's commit history as the PR was yet to be merged) but I was wondering if I would be marked down for it. If it is approved, how do I ensure I do not get marked down during the practical as it is flagged that I force pushed in Github? Should I leave a comment message which informs my evaluator that it is approved? Thank you!

Hi @TiwKangXu ,

This is what I have gathered from my experience and from web resources such as StackOverflow based on the information provided in the issue that you have raised.

The error is likely occurring because of a discrepancy in the package name used in the mainClass configuration in your build.gradle file and the actual package name in your code. You may try to go through the following steps to fix the problem:

Update build.gradle:
In your build.gradle file, make sure that you have the correct package name set for the mainClass configuration. Since you mentioned that you changed it to duke.Duke (line 31 in build.gradle), make sure it matches the package name of your Duke.java class.

My file structure is as follows: src > java > main > geraldbot > Duke.java. The following is the way that I have configured my mainClass in build.gradle:

application ``{``
    mainClassName("geraldbot/Duke")
``}``

Rebuild JAR:
After making sure that the package names are consistent, rebuild the JAR using Gradle to ensure the changes are reflected in the JAR file.  Afterwards, run the jar file to ensure that the JAR is built correctly with the updated package configuration.

After carrying out these steps, open Duke.java in IntelliJ and run it. Since you've updated the package name in both the build.gradle configuration and the source code, you should no longer encounter the LinkageError when running the program within the IDE. Hope this helps.

Thank you Professor Damith for the prompt response. I have committed changes in the previous week in another PR so this will not be an issue. Could I double confirm that it would not be considered a "bad software development practice" where I could be marked down? If it is not, should I leave a comment to inform the evaluator that the force-push to update the commit comment was approved?

Thank you for the prompt response. In this case, we will make most of the amendments in the UG. As for the incorrect command result output, the result is shown in the image below. We intended to show a more user-friendly success message instead of the convulated connectify.model.person ``{`` ... ``}`` message. May I ask if that is allowed? Or should this be flagged in the UG?

I'm also not sure if this is relevant information, but before this there was another error, which was that gradle compiled the project in Java 21 instead of Java 11, so the app could not run on my friend's system. I did not change my default java version in my environment until now, so after I did that, rebuild, and make using shadowjar again, that issue was resolved, but it now created this issue. 

Maybe me not changing my environment java version until very late might have something to do with this current issue, I'm not sure.

I haven't had any issues working across Windows and macOS with the same git repository. 

However, I have faced issues when accessing the same repository on Windows WSL (Ubuntu) as described in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53900839/git-repo-gives-contradictory-info-from-wsl-than-from-windows

TLDR: Difference in the way line endings are interpreted causes conflicts on every line.

Fixed the issue with `git config --global core.autocrlf true`. Alternatively, you can set the git config locally in the `.git` folder for the project.

> Do you mean that if every team member applies `git config --global core.autocrlf true` in their local machine, then the team should no longer face conflicts arising due to line ending representations across different operating systems?

You can read https://blog.chapagain.com.np/git-fix-differences-created-by-line-endings-in-files/ and https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration (search autocrlf) for more information on the differences.

TLDR: 
If you don't face any issues, then I guess it's fine to leave things as they are. Otherwise, you can do:  
`git config --global core.autocrlf true` on Windows
`git config --global core.autocrlf input` on macOS/Linux

I'm not 100% sure about whether everyone needs to do this on their own machine. I think it suffices if the person facing the conflicts does it. Would be good if more people can confirm.

Read: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244954/why-cant-i-just-create-another-scanner-object-after-using-scanner-close

TLDR: It seems that sc.close() closes the `System.in` input stream, which means you can't recreate a new Scanner from it again.

It seems like you haven't pushed your tags to GitHub.

When you run `git tag` on your machine, it only creates the tags in your local repository. Doing `git push` will only push your commits to the remote repository, and will not include the tags you have created locally. You have to do an extra step of `git push --tags` to push your local tags to the remote repository. 

See https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/22#issuecomment-1691864201 for an overview of what you should be doing.

In my opinion, there are two factors to consider:
1. How many people are working together on the repository?
2. Which branch are you pushing to?

For iP, since you're working alone on the project, it's probably quite reasonable to do so. If you don't like having buggy code in `master`, you could always branch out to resolve the code first, then merge back into `master` later on. If you really hate buggy commits in particular, you can do things like `git commit --amend` or `git rebase` to clear buggy commits after you fix them, but note that those will probably require a force push afterward.

For tP, you probably want to avoid pushing to branches that are shared with your group mates, in case they accidentally pull from them. I'm not sure what the tP structure is, but if it's done in forks, then it shouldn't be a big issue anyway.

> @tayruxin You can consider omitting those extensions and simply adding a note `Extensions X, Y and Z are handled similar to Un`

Does this mean that we should create an extension scenario with the precondition being "the index is invalid" and the postcondition as "use case resumes at the specified steps"? as seen below: 

```
E1: Handle Invalid Input
- Preconditions: User input is invalid
- Main Flow:
  1. System displays an error message indicating the input is invalid.
  2. System prompts the user to correct the input.
- Postconditions: User receives feedback about the invalid input.
```
We will then reference this extension by E1. 

or..... should we have a separate use case for example, "Warn on invalid command" with the system being the actor

We would like to clarify which way of handling is better since duplicated exceptions are not mentioned explicitly in tutorials or the textbook. 

Thank you!

Hello professor and classmates

When my iP program starts to run (both in IDEA and running the fat jar with `java -jar` command), the GUI window currectly pops out, but also leaving a warning message in the console
`Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @xxxxxxxx'`
(where xxxxxxxx is some random hexadecimal numbers, seems like some kind of object address)
Since it seems that this warning doesn't affect anything in my iP (everything works well except the warning itself), should I just submit the final version of my iP ignoring this warning, or should I fix that before submission? If I need to fix this warning, what should I do? 
(I confirm that JavaFX is inside my fat jar since when I unzip my jar file I see all javafx files inside)
Since the deadline for final iP submission is approaching, if this warning won't affect grading or any other thing, I may just ignore it  and save more time for checking and finalizing other things in iP.
Thanks!

Hello professors and classmates

At the first day when I started using SourceTree, I noticed that whenever I push to remote repo, a window will pop up:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/113608053/e74aaeb6-18b0-4235-a359-5cf0a24245a9)
It will pop twice with the same content, and I just directly click the "select" button twice.

But these days I found out that this window also automatically pops even though I didn't do any push actions or actions related to the remote repo. Same as when I manually push to remote repos, it pops twice. Sometimes I just left SourceTree stays in the system background without closing it, and when I was doing other things with my device, this window also frequently pops up randomly at any time. (Even when I'm writing this question now, it pops again in the background!) **Just like SourceTree is pushing something to the remote repo by itself even without my comfirmation???** Since weeks ago it won't like this, so I tried to solve it. But I couldn't solve it and even deleting all files in local repo then re-clone from remote repo won't solve. Could someone told me why this window pops automatically in the background randomly (without any direction operation or action from me) and how to solve this problem? (My OS is Windows 10) Thanks.

Hello professors and classmates.
From my prior project experiences, I believe that making more classes in my OOP framework will make the overall framework more flexible, modularized and easy to expand, maintaince and use. But one day when I was in high school, my teacher told me that not all programs needs such amount of divided classes and such large framework since designing the framework itself is also time-costly and too-large framework may also be bad. This is totally differ from what I previously believed. So I'm curious about the answer to this question. **Does "dividing everything into separate classes" really a good practice in SE?** Thanks!

From my experiences, commonly when your program needs to store files locally (I've used this before in my video game projects, about storing player records for the game), here is what I usually do:
```
First, check whether the specific file exists on the disk
  If the file not exists, use one of the two options below:
    --Create the file and initialize the file with initial contents. Then check whether the creation is successful or not. (Exception may happen when space is not enough, doesn't have permission (e.g.: Windows UAC) etc. ) and preceed to the next step
    --Use initial data for this user session, skip the next step and write data later in the write phase (actually I prefer this one)
  If the file exists:
    Preceed to the next step
Second, preceed read/write the file like normal. (the so-called "next step" in the above sentences)
```

So to your question, option 2 is much more reasonable than option 1 since users are not expected to create the data file by themselves in this situation. And what's more, I think you don't need to ask the user whether to save the file, just save it automatically to increase the ease of usage.

Try "Level-x" with uppercase "L" instead of lowercase in your tag name? (I'm not sure whether the dashboard system is case sensitive or not)  (update: I see your level-8 can be detacted from your screenshot, so this may not be the main reason for your problem)
Also, go to check that whether you really **created the branch** for level 8, javadoc, coding standard and level 9 and then merge and then tag the merged comment in master branch as required?

No from his screenshot he tagged his commit 5 days ago already @AlagappanRa 
As his branches are also not detacted, I guess he may failed to follow the branch requirements in iP, thus causing the problem (just guessing)

I can not see your branch names from your screenshot, so it's hard for me to give you more helpful information. But instead of just correcting your correct commits, why not try deleting all of your current tags that can not be correctly detacted, **then follow the iP requirements last week starting from A-Packages again all over again?**
Since from my experience, Github commits is really easy to messed up if you are not sure what you are doing (**you may make more mistakes and make your repo more messy during fixing**), so just redo everything may be better than try to fix the current wrong one.

But still weird, though your tags may not be pushed, why your branches on the right is also red?
Did you also forget to push your branches to the remote repo?
I push everytime I make a commit or tag a commit so I never encounter a problem like yours.
Tomorrow if the dashboard is updated but your detaction is still red, then you may need to come back again.

I am unsure why, but when I try to build the `shadowJar`, I am unable to obtain a functional `jar` file.

However, for reason unknown, using `./gradlew shadowJar` results in a functional `jar` file. 

Anyone knows why Intellij can't build a functional `jar` file? If `./gradlew shadowJar` functions well, can I just ignore the fact that my Intellij can't build a functional `jar` file?

Error message from Intellij's `jar` file:

Following the approval of TestFX as an external library, our team has begun implementing automated GUI tests. As @damithc pointed out in his comment, https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/261#issuecomment-1763339592, getting the GUI tests running in CI might be difficult

We've successfully managed to get the GUI tests running in CI when the macOS or Windows Github Actions runner is used, but not for the ubuntu runner. Since it's been mentioned that GUI testing is optional in the first place (https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/271#issuecomment-1768943242), can we then proceed with:

1. Skipping UI tests for the Ubuntu Github Actions runner (dirtily implemented here: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/00b41c45deaa2091b55b45dbea2612b843b541e8/build.gradle#L24-L29)
2. Having our coverage report be uploaded by the MacOS (or Windows) runner instead of the Ubuntu runner, so CodeCov recognises our GUI test coverage (implemented here: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/00b41c45deaa2091b55b45dbea2612b843b541e8/.github/workflows/gradle.yml#L42)

Hi, Team T13-2 managed to get TestFX to work so that we can write UI tests. If you want to do this, here are the steps we took:

1. Include TestFX and write some UI tests -- you can refer to: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/commit/f10b73c8a751dae7a039deda988ba905414d4033

2. At this point, CI may fail because TestFX won't successfully run in the Github Actions Ubuntu runner. Therefore, we simply skipped UI tests if gradle detects we're running on Linux -- you can refer to: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/fab4fb97ef30563bcf393d190f920597f784180a/build.gradle#L27-L35 

3. At this point, CI should pass, but CodeCov will not reflect the increased code coverage since the coverage report is uploaded to CodeCov by the Linux runner. You can switch the runner of the upload step in `.github/workflows/gradle.yml` -- you can refer to the `gradle.yml` changes here: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/commit/136e933b8c8ef5347fdbd74aec72efae7cb09268#diff-0d634959c8276ae976e39ba475e63d0b9ec27824470c79f1971f58fe37c46325

When i first submit the jar file, the jar file name follows the convention.

Hi all, would like to ask for help with regards to this scenario that happens in order:
1) Currently working on a branch in my local repo
2) A teammate of mine have finished their branch feature, pushed it into their fork and create a pull request to the upstream repo (the team's repo) master branch.
3) I reviewed it and approved of the pull request and merged the pull request with the upstream repo's master branch
4) To ensure my local repo is in sync with the upstream repo, I pull the master branch of the upstream repo into my local repo
5) I then push the master branch of the local repo into my fork to ensure that it is in sync

My question here is, between step 4 and step 5, the branch that I am working on will not be the synced master branch that I pulled in step 4. Hence, how do I ensure that that the branch that I am working on is in sync with the pulled master branch?

The line where it says "Added remark to Person:..." seem like is outputting the object itself. I've ensured that my toString() method in the Person class is the same as the one in the tutorial. The link to my branch is here: https://github.com/brendanneojw/tp/tree/tutorial-adding-command

The difference is that in the given README.md file, it is given to be describing the "Features" first then the "Usage" of the action to achieve this feature (the first picture) while the AB3 User's Guide kinda combine them both (the second picture)

Hi all I would like to clarify if the checking of the file/directory that we are supposed to save to should be done:
1. At the start of the program, if file/directory doesn't exist then exit the whole program

In my opinion, I think the 2nd option would be more intuitive and if deciding to go even more adventurous, the program can even create the directory and file for the user. Of course additional checks have to be done to ensure security and permission rights.

Hi prof, i did the checkout at each branch before my final implementation at Level 9 and realised that JUnit testing does work already. I'm quite confused though because at certain branches it doesn't work but as some it does. However it seems like there may be file changes that could cause it and my master branch is able to perform the JUnit testing already. Thank you!

Context: TEAMMATES overall evaluation

I was going to give a team I evaluated 7 for effort, even though typically teams should get 8-12. But before I submitted it, I wanted to check if they had 5 members, because the total implementation effort this team put felt quite less compared to the implementation effort required to create AB3 from scratch. Turns out, they had 4 members only.

Should I stick to my original score of 7, or re-evaluate knowing that there are 4 members in the team?

Hi prof @damithc,

If a team's planned enhancement section contains more than 10 specific feature flaws by doing it in a general manner like this:

`1.  general  description 1`
    - specific flaw 1
    - specific flaw 2
    - specific flaw 3

`2. general description 2`
    - specific flaw 1
    - specific flaw 2

...           

`10. general description 10`
    - specific flaw 1
    - specific flaw 2  

Does this mean we cannot report any of the specific feature flaws even though they exceeded the limit, since by right a team of 5 should only mention at most 10 specific planned enhancements addressing 10 specific feature flaws?

I took some inspiration from another team's UG, and I think I need to credit them. However, I had already submitted the survey titled: "tP code reuse declaration" and had said that I did not reuse anything. Am I allowed to retake this survey?

Also, how do I credit this reuse since this is in docs and not code.

Is it considered an enhancement if we were to now allow characters such as `/` and `-` in person names, when previously we didn't? Because some names can contain `/` and `-` but our application does not allow special characters, and we do not have any special reason for not allowing these special characters. Since valid names such as `Amelia-Rose` and `Vishnu S/O Prasath` are not allowed by the application when it should've, is this considered a functionality-bug and therefore can be fixed?

Our application does not limit the string length of the name of a person.

When a person's name exceeds more than 200 characters (which I think can be considered extreme input?), part of the name is truncated and can't be seen. So, how can I go about this? Is this a bug?

Possible solutions:
1. Limit the number of characters for the name of a person in code (lets say 100 characters), and mention this limit in the UG.
2. Don't do anything to the code. But, mention in the UG that it is best to limit the number of characters for a name to be 100.
3. Same as solution 2, but in addition, mention in the DG `Planned Enhancements` that we plan to forcefully limit the number of characters to 100.
4. Modify the UI slightly to show all the characters of the name without truncation.

I am unsure if the solution 4 is "accomodating 'extreme' inputs" and therefore it is not a bug fix but instead an enhancement. So, between 1, 2 and 3 what should be done? Or is there something else that should be done?

Hi, I was able to publish my website for the iP the first time. My `Ui.png` screenshot even showed in the [iP showcase](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/ip-showcase.html). But, the website had some minor formatting issues, so I changed the `README.md` file and committed the changes. But, the website did not reflect the changes. Initially, I thought it was some website cache problem, so I deleted my cache and even tried opening in a different browser, still no changes. Therefore, I tried to force the change by unpublishing the website and trying to republish it. Searching online, I found that to republish the website, I had to go to the repo's `Actions` tab and rerun the `pages-build-deployment` workflow. However, every single time that I did, the deploy failed.

4. Checked [GitHub status](https://www.githubstatus.com/), everything is normal, including pages.
5. Created an empty commit to trigger a rebuild as stated in a comment from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58358375).

Perhaps I should not have unpublished my website to try to republish it.

@damithc thank you for the reply at such a late hour. If I choose to go with 2 (since each team only has maximum 10 planned enhancements they can add), are testers allowed to point out the bug that: very long input causes UI to truncate the name; even though the UG has stated that it is best to limit to 100 characters?

After experiencing v1.2, I realized that setting up stubs and writing utility classes for testing purposes takes up more time than writing code for the actual features. As a "feature freeze" is implemented in v1.4, we have to implement all the remaining features in v1.3. As I fear that there might not be enough time to extensively write test-cases for the features, is it ok to not write test cases and put them in in v1.4?

While working on Level-7, I encountered a strange issue:
```
File taskFile = new File(somePathToATxtFile);
            Scanner setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
           //some intermediate code

                //while loop does not loop
            ``}``
```
In this piece of code, i try to initialize my list with tasks in the txt file, but the task is not loaded into the list.

```
File taskFile = new File(somePathToATxtFile);
            Scanner setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
           //some intermediate code 
           if(setup.hasNext())``{``

                //while loop starts looping
            ``}``
```
for some reason when I check if the setup scanner is empty or not, the tasks are now loaded into the list!

Can someone explain why checking if the scanner hasNext fixes this code?

regarding the issue mentioned in [https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/6](url) , the following error rises when a "new" Scanner is created during a while loop that doesn't terminate until "bye" is detected:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found
        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1656)
        at Cracker.startService(Cracker.java:15)
        at Cracker.main(Cracker.java:67)
 
```
Why does this arise when manually entering the input does not throw any exceptions?
My hypothesis is that System.in throws the .txt file into the scanner and when a new Scanner is created, the txt file is somehow cleared.

Apparently, I have found some crucial code that caused the while loop to terminate.
The problem is i tried to open a new FileWriter that passed in the same file in the Scanner.
Here is a code that demonstrates this: 
```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerTester ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args)``{``
        FileWriter writer = null;
        File taskFile = new File("./data/list.txt");
        Scanner setup = null ;

        try``{``
            setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
            writer = new FileWriter(taskFile);
        ``}`` catch (Exception e)``{``
            System.out.println(e);
        ``}``
        System.out.println(setup.hasNext());
        while(setup.hasNext())``{``
            System.out.println(setup.next());
        ``}``
        

    ``}``
``}`` 
```
The output will be false.
Running setup.hasNext() before creating the FileWriter will fix the problem for some reason, and the while loop will start looping. This still confuses me.

Thanks for the answer! This certainly explains why I can't retrieve any more lines from the Scanner. However, this code below works for some reason.
```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerTester ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args)``{``
        FileWriter writer = null;
        File taskFile = new File("./data/list.txt");
        Scanner setup = null ;

        try``{``
            setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
            setup.hasNext(); //adding this line activates the loop
            writer = new FileWriter(taskFile);
        ``}`` catch (Exception e)``{``
            System.out.println(e);
        ``}``
        System.out.println(setup.hasNext());
        while(setup.hasNext())``{``
            System.out.println(setup.next());
        ``}``
        

    ``}``
``}`` 
```
Here's how i understand this program:
After I input the file into the scanner, i check hasNext() and should return true (Have not opened filewriter yet)
Afterwards i open the fileWriter, flushing the entire file.
When check the condition of the while loop, it will fail and nothing will happen.

However, adding that one line before opening the fileWriter changes something and I'm not sure how.

However, does this also include a value proposition that has not been fully fulfilled and is left for future implementations?

The website mentions that a feature not solving the stated problem for the intended user is considered a feature flaw.

Hi prof, my team and I would like to be very sure we aren't violating any feature freeze rules. Could you help to verify if any of these are violations?

### 1. Parsing and display of year 0000
We have a datetime input and when user inputs year 0000, it is displayed as 0001. 
We have fixed this to display 0000 correctly.

### 2. Unmark accepting multiple m/
We have an unmark command that is supposed to accept just 1 m/ tag. It accepted multiple and we have since restricted it to only 1.

### 3. Theme command ignoring multiple keywords
We have a theme command that is supposed to change the theme by accepting 1 NEWTHEME field. It accepted multiple and took the first word to change. (e.g. theme dark blue was interpreted as theme dark, instead of its intended error)

### 4. Status lost on tutor edit
Editing a tutor caused its associated schedule's statuses to be lost. We have since updated how the command works.

### 5. Calendar schedule being truncated 
We have a `show` command that would display the schedules in a calendar view.
However for schedules with a short duration (under 45 mins etc), it truncate the schedule’s text due to insufficient width of the schedule box to the extent that none of the words are readable.
Despite this the user can still retrieve the schedule information using the `list-s` schedule command which would display all the added schedules in a list.

We have modified the calendar schedule to not display any text entirely except the index for schedules under 45 mins (this prevents the truncation from occurring in the first place).

### 6. Long fields truncated (schedule n tutors)
We modified the UI view of AB-3 to prevent truncation of long fields with the use of a  horizontal scroll.
However this truncation only occurs for “extreme” inputs (names made up of 40 characters of W character etc) and the truncated field can stilll be viewed by the user in full, by resizing the app window manually (for really long names this can take a while).

### 7. Update schedules ordering when day passed 
We have this feature where the product would sort and separate schedules added by the user into two categories:

- Upcoming schedules (including ones that occur on current date)
- Past schedules (those that occured before the current date)

Currently when the day has passed (date changes to the next day’s date), using of any of the commands does not update the schedules order (move schedules that have occured on that given date to past schedules).
The only way to force this update is to make an edit to a schedule which will update the filtered list of schedules and hence causing a UI update.

We have modified all schedule commands to always sort the list when executed.

### 8. Malformed json causing app to crash
It was stated in the FAQ of feature freeze that the app should support manual edits to the json file. We have updated the product to meet that level of support.

However we did not include the section on support for manual edits to the json file like AB3 did.

### 9. Parsing an Index with a number that is too large returns wrong error message
When parsing a command that uses an index as a parameter, if the index provided is too large (e.g. 99999999999), the parser fails to parse it as an integer and treats it as an invalid parameter and returns an `Invalid command format` error instead of `Invalid index`.

Are we allowed to modify this behaviour to return the correct message by checking if the input is made entirely of numbers before trying to parse as an integer?

Thank you for the clarifications!!

I have a follow question regarding:

> Only if multiple m/ causes the application to misbehave (i.e., crash, give incorrect results, or hinder normal usage). If the application gives the same (or similar) behavior with multiple m/ as it would with a single m/, the behavior is not incorrect (just more forgiving).

Can I check what is considered as incorrect results?

The mark command was intended to only accept 1 prefix like the name prefix `n/` in AB3.
However its current behaviour is such that a series of `m/0 m/0 m/1` would only use the last provided prefix `m/1`, discarding the previous ones.

Is this considered an incorrect result?

> Not necessarily. Just mention this behavior in the UG. Interesting fact: Accepting multiple parameters was a 'feature' in earlier versions of AB3, with the rationale that it allows a user to quickly override an incorrect value of a parameter because for a fast typist it is faster to type the parameter again with the correct value rather than navigate back to the previous location to correct the incorrect value.

Okay I see!

Does that mean if we take, accepting only the last prefix to be the correct behaviour then `theme` using only the first keyword is taken to be an incorrect behaviour?

For the first, the coding standard states:
```
Constant names must be all uppercase using underscore to separate words.
```
I believe that constant means it has to be a static variable. Otherwise, for every instance of the class, I can have a different value of that variable. Hence, we use camelCase in this case.
For the second, it states:
```
Plural form should be used on names representing a collection of objects.
```
Hence, I think we should use ```tasks``` as the name instead. However, if there is a case where ```taskList``` is needed for some reason, we notice the following below the standard:
```
Rationale: Enhances readability since the name gives the user an immediate clue of the type of the variable and the operations that can be performed on its elements. One space character after the variable type is enough to obtain clarity.
```
Hence, I think it is okay to leave it in singular form as it hints to people that it is only one list.

Hi, just a quick question on these two types of variables and how we should declare them in naming. I'm aware that coding standards are just a standard, and they can be changed, just wondering which of the two options we should adhere to or if both are OK.

1. for e.g. a storage class linked to a bot, that is intended to be paired permanently with the bot:
```java
private final Storage ______ = new Storage();
```
what should we put in the space? uppercase STORAGE_FILE (Since it's declared as final) or camelcase storageFile (Since it's mutable)?

2. next, for a variable aggregator such as an arraylist holding multiple objects:
```java
private ArrayList<Task> ______ = new ArrayList<>();
```
I'm aware that the convention recommends a name like listOfTasks; but what if we refer to the arraylist as a single object, like taskHolder or taskList? is that acceptable within the standard of this course?

thanks for the clarification!

Hi guys, update: I found a google style guide [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.2.4-constant-names) that states mutable static final objects should **NOT** be written in uppercase, since they don't adhere to what a constant is. Should we adhere to this standard?

Hi, as far as I’m aware from when I asked a similar question, static final variables are not necessarily constants. Take for example a static final list, as I can still modify this list by adding in new entries even after it’s been initialized. 
Constants can’t be determined just from the modifiers; you have to ensure that the variable is deeply immutable.

This is dependent on the type of the object, by the way, as Google style guide mentions, since just you intending for the variable never to be modified is not enough to call it a constant.

Yes you should check if it’s actually immutable. Otherwise you are indicating to readers of the code that the variable is a constant even though that’s not true. Access modifiers like public/private shouldn’t affect whether something is a constant.

We are intending to tweak the apparent font size of the entire team project website to be smaller specifically in our PDF conversions, either via CSS or website scaling (rationale: the default sizes look too big compared to what text on an A4-sized paper usually looks like).

This will only impact the PDF exports from the output when invoking print, and there will not be apparent changes to font size on the website itself.

I would suppose that is allowed for the UG and DG since there are no restrictions for those. However, the PPP has page limits - hence, would a difference in font size be allowed there?

I understand that if some increments have been implemented in prior weeks, we can either tag the relevant commit or latest commit with said increment. However, what if an increment requires more actions than just a commit tag?

---

For example, in my case, I wrote documentation as I code by habit. Hence, I might have no commits to do in `branch-A-JavaDoc`, nothing to tag `A-JavaDoc` to, etc. 

Suppose I still: 
- create the `branch-A-JavaDoc` branch anyway, 
- tag the top commit with `A-JavaDoc`, and 
- push it with no additional commits (so `master` and `branch-A-JavaDoc` are still pointing to the same commit).

Would that be okay for the auto-grader, or should I intentionally leave some docs out just so I can make a commit with the branch?

Similarly, does this apply to all future increments which may require multiple steps, but are inadvertently completed previously?

A situation where having a `Storage` class may help is if you plan to store other data files alongside your task list in the future (for example, user settings), and you want to ensure they are stored in a common system- or user-defined location.

Example: Data storage conventions are different across different OSes. For instance, these are possible conventions you might follow (may differ depending on environmental variables or OS versions):

- Windows: `~/AppData/Local/AppName/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/AppName`
- Other Linux/Unix variants: `~/.config/AppName`

where `~` represents the home directory.

By having a separate `Storage` class, even if it is simply a wrapper on top of the built-in `File`, you can abstract away any operations dealing with the base directory. For instance, when providing a relative path to `Storage` to save a file to, it may auto-create a missing base directory behind the scenes, then auto-prepend the appropriate base directory to the provided relative path before saving.

With this separate wrapper class, any new files used by future features can easily share the same behaviour above.

I believe the reasons mentioned in 1 and 2 are actually two sides of the same coin. 

Notice `File` and other relevant Java classes themselves are also classes that:

1. require the user to continuously call it, and 
2. requires data passed to it to function. 

and hence technically exhibits the same problem you noted in reason 2. 

With that, since `Storage` is an intermediary of `File` operations (reason 1) it hence makes sense that it exhibits the same "dependency" on each other like `File` (reason 2). 

I feel these design concerns aren't really a big issue if even Java is organised this way.

---

Personally, I think whether you decouple TaskList and Storage is okay either way:

- **IO operations in Storage:** 
  - Since the provided `File` Java APIs also have ways to load and save with different formats via polymorphism, if the purpose of `Storage` is to be a higher-level IO wrapper for internal files, having said class could possibly help in code organisation and future convenience.
  - See also: Java's `BufferedReader`, which is designed to take in and wrap another reader such as `FileReader` for improved performance via buffering.

- **IO operations in TaskList**: 
  - Since it's only used in one place at the moment and we are focusing on iterating on the iP, calling Java File IO APIs within `TaskList` directly has no real downsides yet.

Thank you @damithc 

Updating the font size is done to improve the readability of the page, so that it doesn't look unnaturally big. Despite this, our site will still potentially create similar or more pages than the defaults, as we also included automatic page breaks on areas like headings for similar viewing improvements of the PDF.

My main concern right now is on the PPP. Unlike the UG and DG, it's mentioned on the website that the PPP has a "hard limit" of 2 pages. Reducing the font size has an unintended side effect of making it theoretically possible to fit more content there, so should we be limiting it by something like an approximate word count instead?

Hi Professor

Thank you for reading this question! I would like to clarify whether a change my group wishes to make would be considered attempting to fix a feature or just improving code quality.

We would like to make a few small changes to the code of one of our existing features to improve the code quality that would not affect the functionality of that command.
```
public Command(Input input) ``{``
    requireNonNull(input);

   A = new Person(constant);
   B = input;
``}``
```

As an example, you can refer to the example snippet above. 

The field initially had the field A only. B was added to the command later on as an improvement to the command, which was done in v1.3. However, due to an error on our part, in the initialization of the command, A is initialized to a certain fixed value, as the individual who updated this command did not remove it before the end of v1.3.

The only method currently utilizing field A is the toString method of that command, as can be seen below:

```
@Override
public String toString() ``{``
    return new ToStringBuilder(this)
            .add("A", A)
            .toString();
``}``
```

If we 1) remove the field A from the command, 2) remove the field from the constructor entirely, and 3) change the toString method of the command to not use the field A, but the newly added field B instead, would it be violating the feature freeze? We would like to reiterate that the toString method is not being used in anywhere else in the application, and thus would not be improving any current features of the application.

Hi Professor!

I am writing this question to clarify what objects need to be included within a sequence diagram.

From the module website, it states that we should keep our diagrams simple.

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/94635140/2110d426-06ee-46c6-99c2-c12f45709a74)

I would just like to clarify the third point within this image shown above. If I am making a sequence diagram for the command that handles the addition of new objects into the Model component,

1) Is it a necessity to show the initialization of the object?? Or does it fall under the Model component, and that we should not be mentioning the initialized object?

2) If we do mention the initialized object, should we creating the instance within the Logic box or the Model box? I understand that the object is initialized when the `execute` function of the command is being called, which is under the Logic box, but it is an object that belongs to the Model package. Thus should it be under the Model or Logic box?

Thank you in advance for answering my question professor! I really appreciate it!

Hi Prof,

My group and I would like to check if increasing CodeCov values in v1.4 would be possible? We assumed that the increasing of CodeCov through the writing of test cases would be classified as fixing bugs, as we would be writing these tests in order to find such bugs.

Hi Professor!

Thank you for your quick reply so late at night!

Within this diagram, should we keep it like this, where we do not have an object initialized:

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/94635140/d020c103-2000-42c2-bb67-a9e9ce804521)

Or do we have to initialize the object:

Could I clarify whether the initialization of the Object is necessary or not? From the website,

No Person object is shown in this diagram. Is this because in this case (for DeleteCommand), the Person is already within the model, and as such it does not need to be shown explicitly to simplify the diagram, while for this case (AddCommand), as a new Object is being initialized and added to the Model, it needs to be explicitly initialized within the Logic component and be passed as an argument via the addPerson command into the Model?

From the user's POV, when the command is executed, the command will do what it is supposed to the model, the user will receive a command successful message if its successful, and whatever error message if it failed.

This change does not affect anything user-facing, and does not change how they use the application/what is displayed to them in the UI.

To clarify prof, as long as the changes we make doesn't 1) affect what the user does/is able to do and 2) does not change what they see (UI), it is ok to fix?

Hi I am trying to style my GUI to make it look better. I referred to the code written by @shishirbychapur (Thank you so much and I credited you in my code). However, after I created a chat bubble for containing the text message, I am unable to wrap the text. Previously, I was able to wrap my text with the most basic GUI.

The `Label `that contained my message already has `wrapText = "true"` and I feel that probably something else is interfering with it. 
However, I cannot find out exactly where is the problem. 😢

Thank you for those who took the time to help me debug. I have solved the problem by running git bash instead of Ubuntu. I believe it is a Ubuntu problem. I tried switching to powershell / command prompt first but their commands are different from the Linux commands I am used to. Git bash provides a command line interface for the windows system, emulating the linux environment. Hence simpler for me. Hope there won't be any more problems.

Suppose my UG states that the error message for a wrong command is `message A`. Currently, when said wrong command is inputted into the app, `message B` is shown to the user instead.

`message B` is not wrong per se, but it is too general. I understand that if a message is too general, it is not considered a bug. However, since there is a discrepancy between what the app shows and the expected outcome in the UG, is this considered a bug? And are we able to fix the error message in the implementation to match `message A` in the UG?

Your `build.gradle` settings should target your `Launcher` class instead of your regular `Duke` class. You can do this by changing the `application` field in `build.gradle` to this:

```java
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("duke.Launcher")
``}``
``` 

Do also make sure there is only one `application` field in the file because I noticed you specified it twice.

In order to build using Gradle, the project is configured based on your system's version of Java, not the project's. You need to verify that your system is running the correct version of Java too. You can check your system's version of Java using this command:
```shell
java -version
``` 

You should see something like this:
```shell
openjdk version "11.0.20" 2023-07-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS, mixed mode)
```

Check the build version of Java, make sure it includes support for JavaFX. You can refer to the course website for more info. https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html

Possible solutions that my team thought of as of now:

>a parameter that is specified as optional in the UG is behaving as if it is compulsory

We did specify the parameter as an optional parameter in general in the UG, but it is and should be behaving as if it is compulsory through the specified command. I have added the relevant UG sections and actual behavior below:

Command description:
<img width="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/110957690/994cd107-9452-4737-b6ff-b5b346ad54c6">

Actual expected behavior:
The parameter in question is `Interview Score`, where a "-" is used when user never added the parameter.

<img width="215" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/110957690/03957c01-6db1-44e3-9f5b-38dbe1936643">

General description of parameters in UG, where [ ] parameters are optional:
<img width="534" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/110957690/57ae64ce-25ab-4c68-b375-9539f486f255">

@damithc 

As of now, If the optional parameter is not present (`Interview Score`), the command will not cause any changes to the main UI window, as shown below:
<img width="695" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/110957690/31c6576e-2dac-44fe-a6a7-8d0a93cc0470">

The expected behavior as stated in the UG excerpt, even if the optional parameter is not present (`Interview Score`), the command is supposed to generate a pop-up UI window, and still show the parameter as a dash as shown in the image below:
<img width="656" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/110957690/76e1c526-1a0e-44b5-8fb8-a64ab44d59e4">

Hi prof,

Suppose we have this scenario.

Issue A: Medium, all other issues are duplicates of this
Issue B: High
Issue C: Low
Issue D: Very Low

Suppose the dev team wants to mark issue A as Low, and all testers want to keep their original severity (but agree that their issue is a duplicate). The dev team only responded to issue A, reasoning why it is not medium and it should be low.

1. Would the same teaching team member be handling the dispute for all 4 issues to remain completely objective, or will the teaching team only consider the argument laid by Issue A, the main issue? How would the teaching team handle 4 different "disagree" arguments from 4 different issues?
2. Would issue C's only option be to accept the dev team's feedback since they want to downgrade from medium to low, which is the issue's current status anyway? How does it affect Tester C's accuracy if the dev team's argument gets accepted or rejected?
3. Would issue D's minimum severity automatically be increased from Very Low to Low? How does it affect Tester C's accuracy if the dev team's argument gets accepted or reject? 
4. Should Tester B be arguing that the issue is severity medium or high?

Thank you

In the course website, it was stated that

Hi Prof @damithc, thanks for your reply. I still need some clarification on accuracy as I'm in this particular situation:

Issue A: Severity `Medium`
Issue B: Severity `Low`, marked as duplicate of A and is my current issue

The dev team is arguing for Issue A to be lowered to `Low`, and I suppose all I need to do is agree.

I'm under the impression that if the teaching team agrees with the developer and chooses `Low`, the severity will match mine and will result in my accuracy increasing.

However, if the dev team sides with Tester A and keeps the severity at `Medium`, will this negatively impact me in the sense that I will no longer receive my accuracy increase? In this case, is there anyway to defend my bonus accuracy to keep the severity as `Low`?

Thank you!

1 Every single team project, past, now and future, will be qualified for this "severity high" bug that "happen frequently" and "prevent the potential user from using the app", as it is literally impossible to store data "locally and human editable" and could withstand arbitrary modification at the same time.
2 PE will downgrade into an endless and meaningless game of  abusing other's system.

I have two PR based on branch 1 and branch 2 respectively.

The branch 2 is created based on branch 1, but revert all the extra commits in branch 1.

When the PR based on branch 2 got approved and merged, the PR on branch 1 is also automatically merged, and closed, except no change to the mastery branch.

The irritation does not come from the invalidity bug the tester raise, but from how the how the tester is being "Excessive incorrect downgrading/rejecting"

Firstly, the reported issue is with clear evidence not a bug: ["It's great if you handled such 'invalid data in the JSON file' situations. But I don't think we want to enforce it as a requirement or consider it as a bug, especially because we didn't mention such a requirement earlier."](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S2/forum/issues/243)

This is fine. What irritating are the next two:

Secondly, the severity is extremely inflated. 

The frequency this issue will happen will be extremely low given that this issue only happens when advanced user with with reasonable intention and skill to modify data file directly, and make mistake in the process.

The severity of this issue is also low, as we repeatedly warn the user to make a copy of the original data file before modification (which should be the expected behavior of advanced user anyway, even without the warning). So even when this issue happen, it will only cause a small inconvinence. It would not block user from using the app.

This makes me question the intention of putting this as severity high.

Thirdly, the way the tester inject bugs in the storage is indeed intentional and malicious. 
No reasonable advanced user with reasonable skill and intention of modifying the data file directly will put null(unquoted) randomly in the data file when it clearly contradicts to the format and pattern the data is stored.

Why so hastily hinting at my "low standard of work as a software engineer" before you know more detail of the case?

The irritation does not come from the invalidity bug the tester raise, but from how the how the tester is being "Excessive incorrect downgrading/rejecting"

> @yiwen101 "Excessive incorrect downgrading/rejecting" refers to developer response, not bug reports. Testers are not downgrading/rejecting, they are reporting things they think are bugs. If you feel like the tester is _rejecting_ or _downgrading_, you may not be looking at the tester's role in the right way.

> Not commenting on this specific case but in general it is a good thing when testers do all sorts of nasty things to the product and report what they observe. This is because developers tend to (subconsciously) test their own products 'gently' while testing also need to be 'destructive' at times. Many such observations can be considered and discarded but some may point towards bugs or where the product can be more resilient.

> One of the takeaway from this phase of the PE is to train yourself not to get upset over bug reports. It is not the natural reaction but that's why it needs training. It's like having too many food options at a buffet. Sure, it takes extra time to consider all options, but in the end, you just eat what you want and ignore the rest. Likewise, just reject the bug reports that are not really bugs. In our context (not in a real project), you can also be thankful that the tester wasted time reporting non-bugs, thus possibly reducing the real bug count, and your penalty.

> Considering the above, you may be able to reject such bugs, in which case only the tester lose accuracy, no harm to your team. In a real project scenario (not in our tP/PE context), it is best not to assume the user will not do this and that. For example, it is also possible that an amateur will think of themselves as an 'advanced user', try to modify the data file, and mess it up. While it is fine not to cater for everything user might do, it is also good to be able to survive or gracefully fail no matter what the user throws at your application.

I see. Thank you for your prompt and kind response.

"One of the takeaway from this phase of the PE is... It is not the natural reaction but that's why it needs training... the rest."

I appreciate how enlightening the response is. Thank you again for not only correcting my wrong cognition about testing, but also guide me to adopt growth mindset and benefit from the event.

Hi, from my experience, sometimes you need to wait for a while for the codecov page to update. Another thing you can try is to push a commit to your fork (e.g. ammend the README file) and create a pull request. This will prompt codecov to run and if you can see the codecov checks below the build checks like:

Instead of running `gradlew clean test`, you can run `gradlew clean build`, and see if it tells you any more useful info

Also, you can trying rolling back or upgrading the version of fasterxml/jackson databind in dependencies of your build.gradle to see if it works. Currently it's 

```
 implementation group: 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core', name: 'jackson-databind', version: '2.7.0'
 implementation group: 'com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype', name: 'jackson-datatype-jsr310', version: '2.7.4'
```

https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind you can refer to this and try one of the newer versions. Seems like 2.7.0 was quite a while ago

Just throwing ideas I too am confused. But my best guess is that the version of fasterxml you have in your project isn't stable for mac specifically somehow

two bug reports can be flagged duplicates if they are not obvious duplicates but "cannot be fixed independently". I want to clarify if it qualifies if the solutions to the two bugs have a high degree of overlap. In particular, does it qualify if:

1. The problems are with `ACommand` and `BCommand`. The problem can be resolved by declaring a new method `example` in `Model`, but the two command classes `ACommand` and `BCommand` still needs to make independent calls to the method `Model::example`.
2. Both problems are associated with the generic method `X::&lt;T>method`, which depends on a generic class `G&lt;T>`. Here `X` is a class declared in the programme, and `G&lt;T>` is a generic class imported from a java default package. `T` binds to class `A` in problem 1 and `T` binds to class `B` in problem 2. Both problems can be resolved by declaring `T` in the generic method `X::&lt;T>method` to extend a new interface `I` that has method `example`, i.e. `&lt;T extends I>`, so that `I::example` can be called in the method. The code now will only compile if classes `A` and `B` implements `I`, however, the implementation of `I::example` must be correct in `A` and `B` in order for each problem to be resolved.

Also, can I ask if I can use the team's code base to prove that the two problems cannot be fixed independently?

Hi prof, our team face a similar issue with number 9, but our case is slightly more complex as we use the same index parsing logic in two cases:

1. For parsing preamble. If the index is small and invalid, the error message is `invalid person index`. If the index is large, the error message is `invalid command index`. This might not be considered a bug as the error message may not give incorrect information.

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/87511888/87ea80ff-a865-435f-9aa8-26dddc2d937a)

2. For parsing index of the item. If the index is small and invalid, the error message is `invalid index`. If the index is large, the error message is `index is not a non-zero unsigned integer`. This can be considered a bug because the large integer is still a non-zero unsigned integer.

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/87511888/6a1fcf91-ef89-4aa5-9992-d354a6b3949b)

We realised that while trying to fix the second case, the code changes will also be fixing the first case. May we ask if we are allowed to fix the parsing logic to handle large integers in this case?

During my PE, I found that the group did not handle an invalid input - When I tried deleting a class that does not exist, there was a Java Exception caused and so there was no error message that popped up (and the command result message box did not change). I had specified this bug to be a functionality bug but the dev team disagreed and tagged it as a feature flaw. Can I clarify that this is a functionality bug and not a feature flaw as this functionality doesn't work as expected as we would expect an error message when the user tries to delete a class that is not in the list, which the user might accidentally try to do and so is a legitimate user behaviour that is unhandled.

Hi, I had a question regarding whether an error handling that I recently added would be acceptable with respect to the code freeze. 

Prior to the code freeze if someone typed in "delete -1", there would be an error stating that "There is no such recipe with that uuid". However, since it is an invalid uuid since uuid's have to be positive, this error message is technically not right and might be more appropriate for uuid's which are valid but don't exist currently. Hence I wanted to check if I could perform additional error handling at the parser stage for when the id is less than 0, which would then display an error message like "This is an invalid uuid".

Hi prof, my team has some clarifications regarding some of the bugs we received. 

1.  Glossary lacking the term JSON [#2295](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/2295)
So for this issue we were wondering if this is considered a bug since JSON is a commonly used abbreviation that most developers would be aware of.

2. Allows appointment time with 0 minutes [#4772](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/4772)
For this issue, we allowed for users to have appointment start time and end time be the same so as to allow for appointments where a user may not know when the end time is or simply for very brief appointments. The only constraint our UG mentions is that the end time cannot be before the start time and even that the start and end time can be the same(as shown in the screenshot from our UG below). Hence we feel that this should not be a bug. 
<img width="917" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-19 at 12 05 12 AM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/98753425/105af5ee-3e48-4586-b548-e56d6f6ef926">

3. Lack of Parser for List commands [#4462](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/4462)
We feel that this is not an issue as we felt that the ListCommand relation with the MediConnectParser would be too trivial to show hence we only showed the more complicated commands which required the additional XYZCommandParser class.

4. Some remnants from address a book[#4142](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/4142)
Our package name is still addressbook, therefore we left the name of the log file unchanged as well.  Hence we feel that this is not a bug as well.

5. Able to add appointments whose date span across multiple days [#2676](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/2676)
We feel that this is not a bug. This is because our UG only states the constraint of the end time being after the start time as show n in the screenshot  under point 2.  Moreover where do we draw the line between an appointment being too long?

6. No warning of using PlantUML [#4460](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/4460)
We did provide a warning for the first instance of a sequence diagram in the dg but we failed to provide the reminder again for the subsequent diagrams. This was because we did not want to repeat the same information over and over. The below screenshot shows the warning message.
<img width="960" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-19 at 12 16 46 AM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/98753425/22941ada-4e69-49b3-a2f2-fd298ae7ccbc">

Also if this were to be a bug we would like to argue that it be a veryLow severity bug as it can be deemed a cosmetic bug as it does not change how the feature would be implemented by a developer as java makes use of a garbage collector and the developer does not have to dereference the object manually.

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: Clarification regarding sequence diagram**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/455" expanded>

May I clarify how objects that are parameters are represented in sequence diagrams? In particular, for example if there is a command that has an Index object as a parameter how should it be represented? Moreover, lets say there is a setPatient(Patient, Patient) method, how do we represent the two patient objects in a sequence diagram? Below is the example from AB3's DG where index is represented simply as an integer.

For our own diagram below,  we are unsure how to represent the patient objects inside the setPatient method call.

My team has clarifications over 2 issues that we aren't sure we are allowed to fix in v1.4

1. Editing a doctor's or patient's nric into an nric that does not exist in the system. 
Currently our app allows this to happen. However the expected behaviour is that there be shown an error message when there is an appointment where patient and doctor does not already exist in the system. Would fixing this issue be a violation of the feature freeze rules?

2. Pop up window does not pop up after minimising the pop up window. 
This is an issue where if the user types in a command view_a/view_d/view_p, a pop up window appears. However, when the window is minimised, and the same command is typed again, the window does not pop up.  Again, would fixing this issue be a violation of the feature freeze rules?

@damithc In our case the setPatient(Patient, Patient) method, takes in parameters the patient to be edited and the edited patient. In our diagram above we have omitted the method call that returns the patient to be edited. In this case how do we represent the patient to be edited parameter? 

Also regarding the orginal AB3 diagram, where the index object containing 1, is written simply as the number 1. Is this the proper notation to represent the Index object?

Hi Prof, our team has received a bug depicting a program crash using our application. To clarify, in the terminal, there seems to be null exceptions thrown. However, there is no program crash as stated in the description. We would like to check what response we should give for this issue,  as we cant explicitly reject it because it is still valid but at the same time the issue is unclear.

Hi Prof

My team and I discovered a bug where out filter feature for our patient and dentist accepts extra attributes and the command is not what we had envisioned and expected.

For example, a proper command is filter-dentist / filter-patient a/ATTRIBUTE k/KEYWORDS but if the command is filter-dentist / filter-patient a/ATTRIBUTE k/KEYWORDS k/KEYWORDS, meaning more than one k/ happens, the filter feature will be conducted based on everything after the first k/, meaning filter will be on KEYWORDS k/KEYWORDS. 

We fixed this as we consider it to be a bug, as the expected behaviour when the command is not in the format filter-dentist / filter-patient a/ATTRIBUTE k/KEYWORDS  should be to throw an exception that it has to be in this format.

I would like to confirm with you if this is allowed or if we will be required to revert this change.

Thanks.

Hi, for context, our app ToothTracker allows patient and dentist records to be added. However, it is highlighed by one of the testers during PE-D that our app cannot handle records with the same name. eg there can only be 1 "John" in the system, or "John Tan" in the system. Are we allowed to fix this and handle duplicate records to be more like how in the real world it is, where a dental clinic management system will likely have multiple records with the same name, but differing attributes such as phone number and address?

If we are not allowed to fix this, will we me marked down during the final PE?

Thank you.

Bug report number is 395. We were not able to reproduce the program crash which was stated in the bug description. However, the screenshot also showed null exceptions thrown in the terminal which we were able to reproduce. But the null exceptions had no impact on the program crash. Hence, we believe that the tester might have misunderstood that his app crashed when he saw the null exception warnings.

Hello Prof. In the beginning of our tp, I have defined the overall data structure and basic class which my teammates modified later on. However, some of the files I contributed were moved to other directories by other teammates (copy and paste to the new directory and delete the old one) during our production and my contribution for that part is completely gone (not reflected in the tp Dashboard).

In addition, our team produced the User stories in a google doc first and one of us put them in DG which results in that none of the others have contributions to User Stories reflected in the tp Dashboard.

When we divide jobs, one of us is fully responsible for the demo video production (becuase he is the only one who is familiar with video editing) and others work on UG and DG. So how can the demo video be compared to the contributions in UG and DG?

How will these affect our grade and what should we do about it?

Our tp design involves three types of users: project manager, team leader and developer. Each has different level of accessibility to the stored information. It is like project manager can create, read and write; Team leader can read and write; And developer can only read.

We are planning to ask the user what is your type of user when our application starts and enable functionalities accordingly. In this way, only one user is using the system at one time on a single computer, but does this satisfies the Single-User Constraint of tp?

If not, then we are planning to make our target user be only the project manager, but we are just worried that not sufficent work is done for tp.

So our project is creating a tree structure to store contact information of a team for a sofeware development project where the root node the is the project manager's contact information. Others are divided into groups with one team leader for each group. The project manager has reference to all the team leaders. The team leaders have reference to the project manager and the developers in their group while all developers only have reference to their team leader.

It is up to the project manager to create the tree structure first and team leaders can help fill in all the contact information. Then, if anyone, including developers, needs to find someone's contact information. He can use our application to find it.

Our system will just store all the contact information added by the PM and team leaders on the computer which our applicaiton runs on. When other users come and use our application on the computer, the system will display the contact information, maybe with some addtional information as well, and that is all. However, the PM has the ability to hide his contact information to developers because they should contact their team leaders first rather than contact the PM directly.

Team leaders can edit or update his and his developers' information, but only the PM can create or delete identities (ie. add or delete a developer or a team leader). All the modifications are done on one computer and developers can just search and view.

Hi Prof, our team discovered the following bug in our app:

1) Create a leave application (Leave Application 1) tagged to a person e.g. Person A. The leave application will indicate that it belongs to Person A.
2) Close the app.
3) Reopen the app.
4) Rename Person A to Person B.

This causes a bug as Leave Application 1 will not update to indicate it now belongs to Person B. This is an issue for the following reasons:
1) When trying to find leave applications belonging to Person B, Leave Application 1 will not appear even though it is supposed to belong to Person B.
2) If we close the app and reopen it again, Leave Application 1 will disappear since leaves are loaded only if they can be associated with an existing person in the address book. Since Leave Application 1 is associated with Person A and Person A no longer exists in the address book, Leave Application 1 will not be loaded and thus be lost.

We noted that the leave application does update if it was created in the current session i.e. the following sequence works:
1) Create Leave Application 2 tagged to Person A.
2) Rename Person A as Person B.

Leave Application 2 will update to indicate it belongs to Person B. As such, could we argue that there is a reasonable expectation that the person's name in the leave application should change when the person's name changes and thus be allowed to fix it? Our team has identified a fix that only requires changing one line of code, thus there is minimal code change. Thank you!

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Clarification regarding acceptable bug fixes**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/410" expanded>

Hi Prof, while reviewing our existing commits for v1.4, our team realised there were some bug fixes that we were unsure whether they might violate the feature freeze, and thus, we would like to seek clarification to decide whether we may have to revert some of our changes. They are as follows:

1) For some of the commands, we noted in the UG that missing fields and invalid inputs would throw specific error messages, but currently they all return the generic "Invalid command format" error message (e.g. [106](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/issues/106) , [113](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/issues/113) ). Our team feels that since the app is not behaving according to what the UG describes, it might be considered a bug, but we would like to seek your opinion nonetheless.

2) There is a bug where adding a tag to the person would cause the employee list to reset and display all employees rather than showing the same filtered view as before (see [120](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/issues/120) ). Our team feels that the reasonable behaviour would be not to reset the list when a tag is added and has identified a fix involving deleting one line of code, but are unsure if it can be considered a bug.

3) Within the usage message for one of our commands (`add-leave`), it incorrectly lists the Description field as a required field rather than an optional field, which is the behaviour of the app as well as what the UG describes (see [124](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/issues/124) ). Are we allowed to change the usage message to reflect the correct format?

4) Currently, the name field only accepts alphanumeric characters and spaces. However, this would mean that valid names e.g. Daniel Day-Lewis would be rejected, as it involves a hyphen. As such, can we modify the validation to accept these names?

5) Our app currently uses a CSV parser with semicolons as the delimiter. However, we are considering switching to comma delimiters instead, as highlighted by (135)[https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/issues/135] . From the bug report created, it is arguably not a bug on the part of our app, as the imported CSV file does not use semicolons as delimiters due to Excel's overwriting of the file. As such, our team is unsure whether we can fix this issue.

6) For the issue of text wrapping/truncation, may we clarify if typical inputs for a particular field would likely result in text overflow, that we are allowed to fix it? For instance, we provide a field for adding descriptions to leaves in our app. Our team estimated that since a typical leave description could be well over 100-200 characters, it would likely encounter text overflow. In this context, may we be allowed to fix it?

7) May we clarify if refactoring exception handling is allowed for v1.4? Currently, we have a PR that refactors exception handling, such that they are handled in a lower abstraction layer. This change will not cause any regressions, but may reduce the likelihood of uncaught exceptions being thrown during PE due to better exception handling. As such, our team would like to know if we are allowed to merge these changes into our repo.

Thank you!

It works for me on MacOS. The app opens up a GUI and can save and load from disk. As @Cloud7050 mentioned, the app created the following file path relative to the location of the jar file: "./src/main/java/data/tasks.txt", which I'm not sure if it is intended. 

Also, the following warning pops up when I try to open the app:

Thanks prof! One last clarification from our team:

We currently have a bug (110)[https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/issues/110] in which our find-all-tag command does not work as advertised in the UG. Currently, what it does is that if the user queries for employees with tags A, B, and C, it returns employees who only have tags A, B, and C exactly. An employee with tags A, B, C, D would not be returned, since it contains a tag D that was not queried by the user. If we changed the method so that this employee is also returned, would it be considered a feature enhancement? Our team is unsure as we have differing interpretations of "match all the specified tags exactly" as mentioned in the UG, and thus would like to know if we could consider this a case of actual behaviour not following advertised behaviour. Thank you!

[One of the reports](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/4266) we received is related to a flaw in AB3 that we were not aware of until much later. This flaw was also not mentioned in the documentation for the AB3

The flaw is that the user cannot use the help command to open the help window if the help window was previously opened and minimised without closing.

Since this is a bug inherent to AB3 and it is separate from the features that we have implemented, would this count as `response.NotInScope`?

`delete INDEX INDEX` will give the user an invalid ID error message (this is expected as my team's current delete command also accepts ID as a parameter for deletion instead of index, and the delete command can only delete 1 at a time unless it is specified to be recursive)

However, `delete INDEX_1 --B INDEX_2 ` will give the message that the item of Type-B is deleted, and if INDEX_2 is invalid, it will give the error message related to deleting Type-B. This also does not check if INDEX_1 is a valid index.

I think every association between two objects/classes has a navigability (Unidirectional or Bidirectional), and you can choose to include this information by adding arrowheads in the UML diagram. So I think navigability is a trait of the association, not something different from an association.

Much like how a road can be one way or two way.

Question stated that "the Goo interface doesn't have any default method implementation", for Bar to be a concrete class it has to provide an implementation for store().

On the other hand the process() method is not italicized and there is no ``{``abstract``}`` keyword. Hence it is not an abstract method and has a default implementation in the abstract class Foo.

Another hypothetical scenario I can think of: abstract class ProgressWatcher could have provided an implementation of the +update(int) method, while the UiWidget just extends the abstract class ProgressWatcher without overriding the +update(int) method in ProgressWatcher.

Now the +update(int) method will be written in ProgressWatcher instead. Hence I think it is necessary to show where there has been an implementation of the +update(int) method.

Extending from my scenario, if the UiWidget overrides the +update(int) method in ProgressWatcher. I think +update(int) method will have to be written in both ProgressWatcher and UiWidget.

Hello, 

This is regarding catcher issue #3653([link to github issue](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/3653)). May I ask if missing an extension in use case that may be deemed as "important" to be considered as a bug? The tester suggested that the below use case should have an extension "for when the class name given is invalid." Our team agreed with his point but wasn't sure if this is actually considered a bug. Thank you!


```
Use case: Remove a student

Hello, can anyone try to help me with my smoke test with Linux OS? I received an automated smoke test results for my first submission of duke.jar as shown in the image at the end.

What I have tried: 
- Dual booting with Ubuntu to test my original jar file that failed the automated smoke test. However, it seems to be able to run fine with Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS. Java version: 
```
openjdk version "11.0.20.1" 2023-08-24

OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.20.1+1-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```
- I tried the fix offered here in #173. Could any Linux users help me to test my latest jar file to see if it work on yours? Thank you!

Hello,
I am currently working on GUI and everything is working fine. However, I see this warning after I run Launcher.main() in IntelliJ.
Although, my GUI's functionality is not affected, I am afraid it might cause some issues later in the semester. I would like to know how I can go about solving this issue as from what I have search online, there are a lot of unfamiliar terms on modules 😥  (or should I just leave it?) 
Thanks for helping!

Right now, our product's edit student command that requires 2 compulsory parameters which is explicitly stated in our user guide. (eg. `edit /s STUDENT_INDEX /c CLASS_NAME [n/ NAME]` where `/s` and `/c` are compulsory parameters.
However, if a user fails to provide one of the parameters, no error is shown as feedback, instead a `NoSuchElement` runtime exception is thrown. Are we allowed to fix this by catching this exception?

Another question is that in our user guide, we only allow users to input numeric characters but failed to catch these exceptions in our code. For example, setting a number to `3` but do not allow `three` as input. A runtime `NumberFormatException` is thrown but not caught. Are we allowed to catch this exception as well?

I faced a similar issue when I tried to distribute my Jar file to a friend using Mac (built on Windows, but unable to run on mac). I believe the issue is with the version of the javafx gradle plugin as brought up by in the Openjfx forum [here](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-gradle-plugin/issues/112). It seems like the issue with the Gradle plugin was fixed in openjfx version 0.0.13, maybe we could have a hotfix after verifying that is the issue.

For now, I tweaked my build.gradle dependencies to declare the `mac-aarch64` architecture and it was able to run on my friend's mac. You can try this and let us know how it goes!

@damithc hi prof, just to clarify again, these runtime exceptions mentioned above that are not caught did not cause any application crashes, and we intend to catch them which will be shown as feedback message, are they still counted as bug fixes and allowed to fix?
</panel>

<panel  header="**6 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/372#issuecomment-1803126275" expanded>

@damithc For the first case, the error occurs as shown in the screenshot, in the try catch block where it parses `Index` and `ClassName`. If the `ClassName` is missing (ie. performing a command like `edit /s 1 /n John` without the `/c` parameter), the `NoSuchElementException` which is thrown by `.get()` is not caught when it is supposed to, in order to throw a `ParseException`. As for the GUI, nothing changes and no error message is shown.

Code:

For the second case, the error occurs when I try to perform the command `setlesson /c T1 /l five` instead of `setlesson /c T1 /l 5`. 
As shown here, nothing changes for the GUI.

We indicated in our UG that we do not allow non-integer inputs and while parsing we did not catch the `NumberFormatException`  which causes this runtime exception:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/94689523/260448a7-ec6b-402c-ba26-0e97e361a7b2)

We intend to show invalid command format message to the user so that they will not be confused by any invalid commands they inputted.

You added the dependencies to Gradle, so it will only work when you run with Gradle.

It works because Duke works with an empty constructor not so much because the filepath is a constant. The `Application.launch` takes in a class which extends the `Application` class. The `Application` class should have an empty constructor.

Hope it helps! 😸

Just like everything in software engineering, I believe there are tradeoffs to making your code "more OOP". OOP definitely brings a lot of benefits in terms of modularization and flexibility of your code.

However, I do think it does comes at the expense of moving quickly. You will often find yourself going back to old code that is working but needing to refactor them to make it follow OOP. So, it does come with some overhead.

Nevertheless, I believe as software engineers, our job is to be able to discern that and balance what is the right amount of "division" is needed.

I realise that the code in part c does not have `break` statements in the `switch-case` block. Will this affect the sequence diagram? Because if `status == 2`, the code will execute `f.increase(2)`, then it will fallthrough to `f.increase(3)`.

I had the same issue as you as well. What worked for me was overloading the Duke Class constructor with a constructor that doesn't take in any parameters (I assume your current constructor takes in a file path as a parameter).

I hope this helps! (P.S i followed the alternative gradle method suggested)

Hi Prof,

I reported an invalid bug (I misunderstood the app) and the developer team agreed that it is not a bug in their response too. However, they did not reject it but accepted it as a duplicate bug to another bug report which is also reported by me (but I think they are totally different)

I disagree with it being a duplicate to another bug report, but I am curious do I still get a +1 for bugs accepted by developer team? I admit that it is an invalid bug but the dev team did not reject it though (despite rejecting it in their response).

Hi Prof, should data file bugs be considered as Medium or Low? The system doesnt crash but the addressbook is cleared, users can still retrieve the data from the JSON file by simply changing the part that causes bugs.

Hi prof,

>c) Case 3: The error message displayed does not indicate the error correctly. For example, when user types in delete
9999999999, it display the error message of invalid command format instead of invalid index
Can we change the error message to pinpoint the error correctly?

The input index 9999999999 is greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, and hence the error meesage says invalid command format instead of invalid index. So in this case is it considered as giving incorrect results?

Hi! An issue received in the PE-Dry run, suggests the Patient Card displayed has a wrong index. 
In the issue's example, after entering command view 3, in the PATIENT BEING VIEWED section,  the index in the left top corner should be 3 instead of 1.

Now the patient index is displayed correctly, but I am not sure if this violates v1.4 constraints.

Hi, our team is currently facing challenges in determining whether the enhancements listed below align with the v1.4 constraints. Could you please identify which enhancements comply with the constraints and which ones may not? Thank you!

1. Current constraints allow appointments with dates before the current date to be added, which does not make sense in the context of an appointment tracker. However, we did not introduce this constraint in our current iteration, is this still considered a bug and as such we can increase the constraints to only accept the dates after the current date.

2. NRIC parameter accepts invalid NRICs such as ones starting with A, which does not accurately reflect real world context. However, this does not affect the overall functionality of the app as valid NRICs are still being accepted, can we increase the constraint to only accept valid NRICs?

3. As our app is an addressbook for patient management, some patients might not have an NRIC, eg foreigners. Is it considered a bug to have the NRIC parameter be a compulsory field when adding a patient?

4. Name parameter currently does not allow dots and dashes. As some people’s names may contain dots or dashes, could we edit the parameter to allow them?

5. When an invalid patient index is entered, our current output is “Invalid output”. A suggestion during PE-D was to make it more verbose. As such, can we edit it to reflect the maximum allowable index that is valid?

6. When a record with duplicate conditions or medications is added, our app allowed the duplicates and ui shows multiple entries of the same conditions and medication. Suggestion was made during PE-D to filter out duplicate entries. Would implementing such suggestion be violation of feature freeze?

7. Is it considered a violation to change the "wraptext" attribute to true for the name label on the current name card, considering that the existing name might be quite lengthy, and enabling wrapping would display the overflow in ellipsis?

Some parts of AB3 currently uses the following convention for writing Javadoc.
```java
/**
 * Replaces the given person ``{``@code target``}`` in the list with ``{``@code editedPerson``}``.
 * ``{``@code target``}`` must exist in the address book.
 * The person identity of ``{``@code editedPerson``}`` must not be the same as another existing person in the address book.
 */
public void setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson) ``{``
    requireNonNull(editedPerson);

    persons.setPerson(target, editedPerson);
``}``
```
Given the same piece of code, if I choose to follow the Java Coding Standard, I might expect something of the following instead, with the most notable difference being the uses of @ tags.
```java
/**
 * Replaces the given person in the list with the edited person.

Should Javadoc be written strictly following the Java Coding Standard? 
If so, I assume that we would not need to modify any previously written Javadoc in AB3?

You will need to create a test folder as seen [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html), additionally you may need to revert the changes you made to the dependencies portion of your gradle.build file as well, I had to undo the modifications for it to build.

You currently have your image extensions as .png in MainWindow whereas your resources are in jpg format.
```Java
    private Image userImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaUser.png"));
    private Image dukeImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaDuke.png"));
```
Additionally, after fixing that error you might need to add the FXML annotation to the DialogBox class, as I ran into another error without those tags.

Hi all, I'd like to ask a question about reporting bugs explicitly discouraged in the documentation. 

For instance, if the user guide warns against following a particular command sequence, which, as expected, resulted in a bug. 

Or if modifying the data file, despite being cautioned not to in the guide, breaks the app, should we still report these issues, or are they unlikely to be accepted due to prior documentation?

It could be because your code doesn't handle the case where the folder and the file does not exist at the start, since the data folder used when you run runtest.bat is different from the data folder used when you manually test your code. Hope this helps!

You can try running the following commands to rename the tag and update your remote repository

Perhaps you might want to try gradlew build, then close IntelliJ and reopen it.

Otherwise, I think a brute force way would be to 
Delete the `.gradle` folder in your project and in your users folder (e.g.,: `C:\users\&lt;username>\.gradle`)
Afterwards rebuild gradle using gradlew build
This will force Gradle to download the packages all over again and could solve the problem
However, don't delete the `gradle` folder in the repo.

The creation of 2 jar files is because you specified the `dependsOn("distZip", "distTar")` in the configuration. So when shadowJar is run, it'll execute these tasks resulting in the creation of the additional ip.jar file.

If you dont need the distribution archives, you can remove the `dependsOn("distZip", "distTar")` line from the configuration and it should only generate the `duke.jar` file.

Hi @damithc, I am the student :p

We can check my tP progress from [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/dashboards/contents/tp-progress.html), with `2695U` as my identifier. The logging is undetected, despite having committed `logger.severe` in [this commit](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/commit/93f5bdc744738731dbbd7724d07389d727ec7159). We can also see that I authored it from the [git blame](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blame/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/UiUtil.java) as well as on [RepoSense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=luna&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=et-irl&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFilesGlob=).

Could this be because I did not add the part of initialising the `Logger` in my commit and the script does not know how to detect it? Shall I re-commit another logging line of code?

As @jiakai-17 has mentioned, you should place your package in the `src/main/java/` folder, Gradle's Java plugin assumes that your code will be in that directory, unless set otherwise.

I think this would be more representative of 

    class foo&lt;T> ``{````}``

    class baz extends foo&lt;Apple> ``{````}``

However, would the representation format between the generic types be acceptable in the above diagram for use in this course?

For our product, we have 4 issues that are independently fixable yet have similar problems. Would the penalty be reduced if we were to combine them as one medium bug, rather than 4 separate low bugs (assuming that the current severity of low for each individual bugs is acceptable)? I understand that on the CS2103T website, it states that "If an independently-fixable yet similar problem appears in more than five distinct places, get our permission to combine them as one bug (in which case we'll require you to increase the severity to match the frequency of the bug).".

I share the same question as @GohTengFong, how do we decide on when to put package private? Is it correct for me to say that any attributes without visibility will be considered as package private?
For example:
`String heading` -&gt; ~heading:String
`public String heading` -&gt; +heading:String

Another question is, do we only draw the composition relationship when the question gives the "explicit keywords"?

I would like to ask if handling extreme user inputs that cause the app to lag and become unresponsive would be considered a violation of feature freeze in v1.4?

Perhaps validity checks can be tweaked to accommodate the upper and lower bounds of user input? Bearing in mind of the feature freeze, there will be no new error messages added to the UI or shown to the user. Instead, I intend to use the standard invalid command error message that has been present in the v1.3 codebase.

In the case of 'extreme' inputs such as adding a person's name that contains 1 million characters which in turn causes the app to lag considerably, I am not clear if this would fall under bug (q5) or planned enhancement (q8) based on this week's [tutorial](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-w12.html#2-start-fixing-ped-bugs-before-the-tutorial)), hence the question. Thanks in advance!

May I know if the dashboard is able to track contributions if I added my name to .gitconfig? The reason i added my name was because I noticed duplicate authors in my commit history which has not posed a problem thus far. As such, I tried to follow my friend's gitconfig and added my own name. 

However, I only recently noticed that my username is not being shown on commits. As such, I am wondering if my contributions can still be tracked by dashboard. If not, what are the measures I should take to rectify the issue?

Thanks in advance!

@damithc Prof, I have checked the dashboard and it does reflect commits from my GitHub username as expected.

Prior to pushing new commits to the [pull request](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/pull/63), I did Gradle Test locally in my Intellij (Windows) using  `./gradlew clean test`. It passed all cases and showed the following.

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/96626287/508932c5-d926-426e-9112-440b9e53b09a)

Nonetheless, after I push these commits, it failed all Java CI Checks initially (ie. for ubuntu, macos, windows).
I then rerun the Java CI Check twice without pushing new commits as I was sure that the 5 errors shown were fixed, and this time ubuntu and windows managed to pass the CI Test.

However, the Java CI Check for Macos still did not pass and is now showing the same 5 errors as mentioned earlier. The mentioned errors can be found in this [GitHub Actions Log](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/actions/runs/6495863766/job/17641639876?pr=63).

Group members with different OS (ie. Macos and ubuntu) have tried running gradle test locally and passed all cases as well. 
How else should I be debugging this or is it a GIthub Actions/ Java CI issue?

Thank you for the idea. I have tried rolling back and upgrading to a number of versions. Both did not work. For upgrading specifically, it introduced a new [issue](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1422), where relative paths are deserialised into absolute paths, causing some assertions to fail. 

ie.
'org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: &lt;seedu.address.commons.core.Config``{``logLevel=INFO, userPrefsFilePath=preferences.json``}``> but was: &lt;seedu.address.commons.core.Config``{``logLevel=INFO, userPrefsFilePath=C:\CS2103T\tp\preferences.json``}``>
'

With regards to the pattern,
> @WeeeHung While waiting for others to chime in, you can try rerunning CI a few more times to see if some pattern emerges or if it is totally random.

I just found it strange that sometimes the Java CI check fails on Windows and Ubuntu with the same errors as macos, but this get fixed after rerunning. I guess the only pattern here is rerunning works for Windows and Ubuntu.

Thank you so much prof, we have just figured out the issue and all OS is now passing the CI Check.

The problem was with the overloaded JsonAdaptedPerson Constructor that we have created. We overloaded the constructor because we added new fields to Person Constructor but have yet to make corresponding changes in Test folder. As a result of this overloaded constructor, Windows OS occasionally fails and Macos always fails potentially due to how they interact with the JsonCreator and JsonProperty.

I just tested your jar file and everything seems to be working fine. I received no errors as previously mentioned by @ryanozx.

App reads the stored data perfectly fine. One suggestion, personally I would not keep the data file inside the src/main/java folder, to avoid any confusion :).

## Context
My team's tp has a feature to enrol a member to an event and there are several operations that can be performed. First of all, we can go into this 'view' mode where user views the members enrolled to the specific event and vice versa. In this view mode, we can then run several operations to edit the data regarding the enrolment.

| Original View | Event View Mode |
|--------|--------|
| <img width="1483" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/56021409/98a32e7a-5ff4-4a07-880b-14c3217f1679"> | <img width="1485" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/56021409/49f532ea-a4ed-476b-8bf8-5079062629b8"> |


## Questions

1. When editing the enrolment information, the newly edited information does not show up on the UI and can only be seen when running the view command again. This was not our intended behaviour as the UI should refresh immediately, however, the team is conflicted - is this a functionality bug or a feature flaw?

2. Similarly, users can unenrol the member from the event which should result in the UI updating, removing the member from the list, however the user remains in the view. Similarly to above, the user can run the view command again to view the refreshed UI. Is this a functionality bug or feature flaw since users might be mistaken that the command did not work.

3. In the event view mode, when users edit the attributes of the member / event (not the enrolment), the UI bounces back to the main view. This differs from the intended behaviour where user should remain on their current view. The team was leaning towards it being a feature flaw but we would like to confirm whether it is indeed a feature flaw.

I understand that when we create unit tests for a particular method, we should isolate the method from its dependencies. However, how about the following case:

```
class Foo ``{``
    public Bar fooMethod() ``{``
        return new Bar();
    ``}``
``}``
```

Here, it seems that it is impossible to isolate `fooMethod` from the `Bar` class as it is supposed to return it. In such cases, can we assume that it is okay not to isolate the two? If so, then wouldn't `fooMethod` depend on the constructor of `Bar` not being buggy? Apologies if this question seems a little silly 😆

Hi there! I finished creating the test cases required for `A-TextUiTesting` and received the following warning when running `git add` on the `.txt` test case file and `.bat` script file:

`warning: in the working copy of 'text-ui-test/input.txt', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it`

I'm not really sure what this warning means. A search on the internet tells me that it has something to do with something called "Line Feed" and "Carriage Return", but I don't quite understand it. A post on StackOverflow suggested running some git config commands, but I'm worried that something might break.

Thank you prof @damithc for clarifying!! 

> (a)
> * For the association between `Brochure` and `Handout`, should it be 2 arrows instead? I feel that this association is not bi-directional but rather 2 uni-directional associations. Not very sure though

I am not very sure of the context of this question. It would seem like having two uni-directional associations would be correct too. If the question mentioned that when a `Brochure` is referenced by a `Handout` object, the `Brochure` object's cover page is not necessarily the same `Handout`, then it would be definitely 2 uni-directional associations.


> (c)

@kiwibang You're right, I am missing a self invocation for `increase(5)` in the `f:Factory` object.

Hi prof,  can we check if the following would constitute a bug fix or a feature change:

1. We used the LocalDate to parse the date input, but we realised that the LocalDate only checks if the date falls between 1 and 31 (inclusive) and not whether the date is valid, i.e. 31/02/2023. This causes no exception to be thrown and it will return a valid date that is closest to the input date instead. For this, are we allowed to change the part since it causes bugs to occur where we are adding in wrong dates and not catching invalid dates?

2. For commandResult messages (success and error messages): can we check whether we are allowed to change it in the following cases:
    a) Case 1: The success message displayed contains wrong information which is critical for the feature/command. For example, 
                      when we add leave of today's date to a person successfully, it will show the working status of the person for today, but 
                      the displayed status is wrong; it displays working instead of on leave.
                     Can we change the success message to show the correct information?

    b) Case 2: The error message displayed might be misleading, for example, for deleting person can be done using index or using 
                       name, but when a user types in a wrong command format, it only displays error for the index portion and not the 
                       name.
                       Can we change the error message to show that name portion as well?
    c) Case 3: The error message displayed does not indicate the error correctly. For example, when user types in delete 
                       9999999999, it display the error message of invalid command format instead of invalid index
                       Can we change the error message to pinpoint the error correctly?

3. Are we allowed to add in requiresNonNull() in our code for inputs?

Thank you!

I personally think creating two different classes for list of tasks and storage is not necessary. The reason for which is as follows:
1. One cannot exist without the other. TaskList will be stored using Storage and Storage serves only as an intermediary between file storage and TaskList; a task already achieved by `IO::File` class.
2. One cannot operate without the other. TaskList's method is continuously calling Storage's method and Storage's method needs TaskList's data passed to it to operate.
3. Neither is used by other feature. At least as of right now, neither TaskList nor Storage is used by any other class and it is hard for me to see in which scenario this won't be the case.

As such, we've created a scenario where we try to separate two tightly coupled systems to achieve what could be done better (in terms of performance, ease of development, and design) by simply implementing additional methods. In case I missed anything, I would love to hear more reason as to why creating the Storage class is actually necessary. Thank you

Hm I see what you mean, thanks for the response. Elaborating on your case, however, unless we want to impose an implicit rule on how the data is formatted for every kind of data (which we don't), we need to basically create an interface with "save" and "load" method that will be implemented differently for each data format. Then we proceed by creating a `TaskStorage implements Storage` class which will be tightly coupled with our `TaskList` class.

While I understand that this is preferable in projects that have multiple features with other data files, I think creating a `Storage` as a class (and not interface) for our project is rather useless; it doesn't solve the problem you mentioned and at least the first two issues I brought up with this design still persist.

I forgot to push one commit into Github. The code, however, does contain the features that the commit is supposed to have, it is just in another commit. (i.e. one commit has two of the increments for the week A-packages and Gradle). Should I push with the tags but on the A gradle commit, or is any action necessary as the code does have all the features for the IP project?

Check that in your build.gradle you have

```groovy
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("duke.main.Launcher")
``}``
```

I'm not entirely sure, but I'm guessing your mainClass is currently set to `duke.main.Main` or `duke.main.Duke` and some code is calling `new Main()` somewhere causing the error you're seeing.

It seems like as long as I have submitted some of the deliverables for this week I should be good as I'll hit the `at least 4 iP weeks` requirement for both, but am I understanding that right?

Would backdating a git commit to within week 4 fix this issue as well?

> Try "Level-x" with uppercase "L" instead of lowercase in your tag name? (I'm not sure whether the dashboard system is case sensitive or not) Also, go to check that whether you really **created the branch** for level 8, javadoc, coding standard and level 9 and then merge and then tag the merged comment in master branch as required?


These were my previous tag names (all lowercase) and they were recognised by the dashboard so I don't think the issue lies there.

> 
> @larrywang0701 Actually, it can be. The dashboard cannot detect things that are not in the fork. So, if the tag was created 5 days ago but was pushed to the fork _after_ the most recent dashboard, it will not be reflected in the dashborad.
> 
> @sushiyade The above appears to be the problem. The last time the dashboard checked your fork, those red tags were not in the fork. But now that they are in the fork, they should turn green at the next dashboard update.


Alright, I may or may not have pushed the tags onto the fork 5 days ago, I have just pushed the tags today and I'll check in again tomorrow morning to see if the issue persists.

Thank you all for your help, if everything goes well by the time the detector checks for my tags, I will close the issue.

What I did is:
1. Go to Project Structure in IntelliJ, then download and change the SDK version to 11.
2. Change the java version in your local computer to 11, by following step 2 [here](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/). Note that the value of the variable JAVA_HOME should be the path to your java version 11 you have downloaded in IntelliJ. For example `C:\Users\Admin\.jdks\corretto-11.0.20.1`.
3. Check java version of your local computer by running `java -version` in terminal to make sure it has been changed to 11.
4. Run the jar file again.

I have tried all ways I could find to fix this but I could not seem to get it to work...

### Some actions I have attempted:
1. Revert commit and merge add-gradle-support again
2. Init and rebuild the gradle wrapper file
3. Check my Project structure and whether my main class is set correctly in build.gradle
```
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("jarvis.Jarvis")
``}``
```

4. Verify my Gradle JVM and Java SDK compatibility

@damithc Hi Prof I have set up the JDK as recommended and I am able to run my JAR file now. Thank you for that!

However, the problem with my gradle still persists. I have pushed a branch to the following link:
### Branch Name: update-gradle
https://github.com/evanyan13/ip/tree/update-gradle

For anyone who sees this, please kindly help me take a look at it :''')

Hi Prof and friends! Great news I finally got my gradle to work after 1 week. 
### So the solution was to move my entire ip to /user instead of /user/Project/

I'm able to get it running from both Intellij and VSCode so I don't think the problem is with the IDE. I'm not very sure why this is the case so I wish to seek advice on this as well, please. Thank you Prof and everyone for your time and attention on my issue.

Hello professors and fellow peers, 
I was able to run the application properly from IntelliJ and downloaded and submitted my jar file on Friday. However, I got an email saying that my jar file was not working properly. After trying to rebuild the gradle file, I got this error when I try to run the Launcher class from IntelliJ.

Right now my team is planning to add a command validity check to our application.

The issue is: 
Our application already catches the invalid input, but it produces an incorrect error message (the invalid input is captured by another validity check).
Are we allowed to tweak the validity check so that the correct error message is returned to the user?

Also clarifying because in either case, the software doesn't really misbehave, so we are not if the feature freeze applies.

Got it, sorry about that, Prof!

**Current behavior:**

Currently, if the user types a filter command with "/taken" and "/with" in the wrong order ("/taken" should be after "/with"), this error message is produced. However, this error message is not very useful since the user has technically typed all the parameters correctly, just in the wrong order.

**Proposed behavior:**
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/113225702/d2d92f04-2655-4d1a-a880-6c88261471d4)
This way, the user has a better idea of how they should rewrite the input.

I used to order the imports manually, which is very time-consuming manually. So here's the configuration for you to auto order your inputs every time you save on Intellij!

1. Go to `Settings/System Preference` > `Tools` > `Actions on Save` and tick `Optimise Imports`
2. Go to `Code Style` > `Java` >  `Imports` > `General` and tick `Use fully qualified class names`. This makes sure all uses of `*` are expanded
3. Under the same `Imports` tab, go to `Import Layout` and rearrange the imports as such:
a) import static all other imports
b) <blank line>
c) import javax.*
d) import java.*
e) <blank line>
f) import all other imports
4. Click `Apply`

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Format of GUI**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/114" expanded>

Hello prof and friends, When I see GUI I interpret it as a graphical interface in the sense that users can call the commands by interacting with the UI like how we would do with normal applications, which is why I created my program to be something like this (delete, add, mark, unmark, task type) are all selected through a user interface.

<img width="814" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/111076731/538c28df-bde6-486a-a35a-9e5a71b0fda1">


But after looking through the other people's screenshots, I realized GUI would retain the same functionalities (all the commands are accessed through the command line, in this case the user input field), just that we have a graphical representation of it in the form of a chatbot.

Will mine fulfill the requirement or do I need to redo it?

OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.64+19-CA (build 11.0.19+7-LTS, mixed mode)
```

I use a Macbook, and encounter no issues or warnings when running the jar file on my local machine. The email also states that there is no issue with running my jar file on Mac. Can anyone guide me as to what changes I might need to make in order to make my jar file compatible with Windows and Linux? I have attached the relevant errors below.

I have resolved the issue. I was using the checkstyle-idea xml as opposed to the checkstyle.xml file used in the addressbook. Likewise I have also updated the directory of the checkstyle to the given directory.

Thank you for your assistance!

I was wondering for the following sections, how should I proceed with the evaluation of the product.

Bugs - 
The description for **below expectations** is `Major bugs. App hardly usable` while the description for **Meets expectations** is `Only minor bugs`
If there is the presence of 2 medium-major bugs (2 commands are straight up unusable - Shows the error message instead of properly performing the command) Should I review as Below or Meets expectations as the current state does not cleanly fit into either of the categories.

Abstraction (methods) - 
The description for **below expectations** is `Very long methods. Deeply nested code` while the description for **Meets expectations** is `No very long methods or deep nesting`.
If there is 1 very long method but the rest of the code mostly has short methods and low levels of nesting should I review it as 'Below expectations' still due to the prescence of the 1 violating method?

On the course website it states that tP v1.1's practice iteration is due by the midnight before the group's tutorial. Is this a specified hard deadline to have v1.1 reached by then?
Because the tutorial for week 7 includes the task of refining the DG after the tutorial.

I was wondering if it would make more sense to leave the PRs for the DG unmerged so that those branches can still be updated (refined) after the tutorial and have v1.1 delivered after the refinement is done (but still before 'Week 8' - before the lecture on Friday)

But this would mean that the v1.1 issues would not be fully solved and the milestone achieved by the midnight before the tutorial session.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: How to respond to illegal modification of JSON files**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/510" expanded>

During PE-D, a few testers have reported issues when they changed parts of the data JSON file manually. For example, changing the format which causes parsing error, adding duplicate entries when our app does not allow through the add command in the CLI, making the file unreadable, etc. 

To "defend" against this, our team has decided to warn against manually editing of the data files in the FAQ section of the UG as we believe that there is too many ways that the file can be modified for us to effectively defend against every case. Even if we were to do so, it seems like it was out of the scope of 1.4.

However, in the actual PE, one tester (#4275) have pointed out, with a high severity, that doing so is a violation of the project requirements. Can we check if this is indeed the case?

Despite the warning in the UG, another tester have edited the the data file (#4402) by inserting a `null` in the first line. How do we respond to this? Would referring them to the FAQ section in the UG section suffice?

Lastly, while we did not warn against modifying the userpref file as it was meant to be modified, the same tester (we believe) has added `null` in the userpref file (#768) which crashed the program. This brings us to the same question on whether such an illegal modification is within the scope of 1.4.

@lunaroddity The reason is because your program is not exiting properly and the scanner is still trying to get input. Try giving the bye command and you will notice that the program does not actually exit. Try using `instanceof` to check for exit condition in your `run` loop:
```java
if (cmd instanceof ByeCommand) ``{``
    isExit = true;
 ``}``
```

Hello, I would like to clarify on what kinds of bugs are considered valid for PE, in relation to the ambiguity of the UG.

**Scenario 1:**
1. UG did not state whether a command parameter is case-sensititve (e.g. Command `addClass class/CLASS_NAME`, where `CLASS_NAME` is not specified as case-sensitive, so an example value of `CLASS_NAME` will be `class1`)
2. When executing another command that uses the same parameter value but with different casing (e.g. `assignClass 1 class/cLaSS1` ), the command succeeds in execution.
3. However, the tester is unable to deem if this is a bug or intended feature due to the different casing.

Do we consider this feature to be a bug, as there is ambiguity in the UG? 

**Scenario 2:**
1. UG did not state what considers a command parameter value to be invalid (e.g. `addPerson n/NAME, p/PHONE`, it is unknown what values are invalid for `PHONE`.)
2. When executing the command, an error occurred (e.g. `addPerson n/Alice, p/1234567E` results in error)

Do we consider this feature to be a bug, as there is ambiguity in the UG?

The issue arises because the FileWriter essentially truncates the file when it is opened for writing. This means that the contents of the file are erased, and the file becomes empty. As a result, when you subsequently call setup.hasNext() right after creating the FileWriter, it returns false because there are no more tokens to read – the file is empty.

hi Jason,
I noticed some changes in the way you wrote your handleInput function. I agree that the splitting of commands into functions would help with structure. 
While the code is much better now, I have a few nits. Given that a majority of code deals with TaskList, perhaps it should be a member variable instead of a function argument?
Overall, good work so far.

@damithc We do not provide that feature as it defeats the purpose of having an encryption feature. We have included an online encryption/decryption tool which advanced users (with the secret key) can used to decrypt the file and encrypt it again after editing it manually.

Hi prof, currently one of my bugs was marked by the developer team as a duplicate (which I agree with), however no response was given by the developer team to the Original bug that is referenced (no indication of whether the Original bug is accepted or rejected etc.).

As I only have the option to select Agree/Disagree for the duplicate status, do I just leave it as Agree and move on?

In the [Conventional Commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), the subject line would be prefixed with a type, such as `feat` or `fix`, which is in lowercase. This conflicts with the [course's Git conventions](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html), which require the first letter of the subject line to be capitalized.

Are we allowed to use the Conventional Commits format? 

Example: `feat: Add save/load functionality`

Or should we follow the course's Git conventions strictly, and use the following instead?

Example: `Feat: Add save/load functionality`

Or are we not allowed to use Conventional Commits at all?

Example: `Add save/load functionality`

In your commit [eb7ee36e19a68ee666531b5ff0a7246361f19ee0](https://github.com/AlainS87/ip/commit/eb7ee36e19a68ee666531b5ff0a7246361f19ee0), I noticed you moved your files out of the `src/main/java/` folder. I think that you should try putting your `alain` package in the `src/main/java/` folder.

The structure should look something like this:
```
ip
├── src
│   └── main
│       └── java
│           └── alain
│               ├── AlainException.java
│               ├── ChatbotAlain.java
│               ├── Deadlines.java

│               ├── ToDos.java
│               └── Ui.java
```

Then change the `application` field in `build.gradle` to:
```
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("alain.ChatbotAlain")
``}``
```

Hi, I would like to ask why the two update methods are shown as public in the class diagram when no access modifiers were specified in the code.![telegram-cloud-photo-size-5-6280732257392113360-y](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/22656175/1b96e236-06b3-4b2b-b60f-65aedb4ee432)![telegram-cloud-photo-size-5-6280732257392113362-y](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/22656175/88db2476-d468-47ea-bf07-03ec22afa55e)

For the activity diagram question, I agree with @TeeRenJing 's implementation of the if-else portion. I think it makes more sense to have 3 different cases: 
1. Where p1, p2 and p3 are all positive,
2. There are 3 consecutive failures, and
3. Else

However, I also added a box containing "user prompted to place hand again" to the else line. I feel like @kiwibang 's way of representing the if-else statements is inaccurate. According to his diagram, 3 failures causes the user to be prompted to place their hand again, followed by the door being disabled, which doesn't make sense.

In response to @GohTengFong 's comment, I believe including the dotted arrows in the object diagram is incorrect, as the `Handout` depended on by the `Section` object may not be the same `Handout` object which it composes. 

With regards to the sequence diagram, within the `[alt]` block, I believe an empty `[else]` block is necessary. To my understanding, inside the `[alt]` block, exactly one scenario has to be chosen.

Hello, this is regarding issue [#1931](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/pe-dev-response/issues/1931). The tester suggested that the below explanation should include the "Telegram" class as the "Telegram" class is part of Person_fields.

Our team was conflicted because the list of fields given (Name, Phone and Email in the DG) was not intended to be an exhaustive list, hence the use of "such as" behind fields. 

The tester put this bug as severity Low. Does this count as a minor grammatical bug (hence VeryLow)? In general, how should we deal with the tester's misunderstanding? I see that there's a paragraph on tester misunderstandings: "Some bug reports that arose from a tester misunderstanding something could be due to a flaw in the documentation e.g., something was not explained clearly enough in the document." but am not sure how to proceed.

Yep, following what Keagan said with reference to the course website link he provided, perhaps you could try using the Azul jdk 11.0.20 version from [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk-fx#zulu) instead of the jdk 11.0.17 version (as configured in your IntelliJ project SDK).

My team and I recently encountered a bug report concerning a specific field, such as 'remark,' not displaying the complete sentence when the remark is lengthy, even after maximizing the window. I recognize that this issue relates to the user interface (UI), and we need to avoid making UI changes. However, my perspective is that the inability to view the entire remark constitutes a functionality bug that should be addressed. I would like to request clarification on this matter from professor. Thank you.

Hello everyone, 

I recently completed iP and successfully generated a JAR file that works fine on my MacBook, as well as some of my friend's MacBook. However, I've encountered a compatibility issue when another friend of mine, who also uses a MacBook, tried to run the same JAR file. Additionally, a friend using a Window laptop seems to be facing an incompatible environment issue too.

Hi prof @damithc ,

Just 2 quick questions on the Sequence diagram. We are currently in the midst of simplifying the sequence diagram to show the internal details of at most one component but ran into a couple of roadblocks.

This is the add command sequence diagram:
![AddSequenceDiagram](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/102083899/7a6b6be6-8ee7-4e9b-a278-d4254aee569e)

Questions:
1. In the above sequence diagram, we are simplifying them to the model containing only one model lifeline. However, the person and course object is being constructed during the process, do we include them in the model component as well? This means that there will be 3 lifelines in the model component? 

2. In AB3, the sequence diagram for the delete operation did not include ParserUtil, but after looking through the code we found out that it goes through ParserUtil, do we include it in the sequence diagram?

Thank you.

2. Overwrite value of environment variable JAVA_HOME to my java version 11 path following step 2 (here)[https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/]
3. Go to project structure and change SDK to 11 and language level to 11
4. Delete .idea and .gradle file
5. Click on Build > Rebuild Project
6. Recreate JAR file using [tutorial link](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jar.html)

Other issues I encountered during my rebuilding of project:
IntelliJ cannot open Terminal Window
1. Go to IntelliJ and click on Settings > Tools > Terminal
2. Change shell path to: `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`
3. Apply changes and restart IntelliJ

Yup the 2 checks requires your newly added lines to be tested with Junit test. I believe you are still allowed to merge even without passing these checks but just take note that you will still have to test these newly added lines of code eventually so might as well pass these two checks now.

i think you might need to set:
```
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("duke.ui.Launcher")
``}``
```
instead of 
```
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("duke.Launcher")
``}``
```
since your Launcher is in the duke.ui package
hope this helps!

When using String.format(), it is natural to use magic literals. For example: 

`String.format("You used \"%s\" as an argument. A bye command shouldn't have any arguments", desc)`

Is this an acceptable piece of code or is String.format() is not a good method to use?

Ah yes, I believe that using constants on String.format() will really only obscure readability. I suppose the real question we should be asking is: how far is too far when enforcing the no magic literals rule?

Good evening Prof, wanted to ask if catching a previously uncaught exception to produce an error message is violating a feature freeze?

What is currently happening is that for some of our commands, edge cases are not producing any error messages or results.

For example, doing a `search n/` command where n/ is supposed to be followed by a name input does not return an error message. The application neither produces an error message nor accepts the command, there is no response after pressing the enter key.  This is because we did not catch an exception arising from this input.

Since it's a invalid command but there are no error messages produced, would this be counted as an incorrect behavior and hence allowed to be fixed?

Hi prof @damithc, my team has an enquiry and would like to seek your guidance. My team's product would validate the courses added as part of the Add Command through an array of strings containing the courses. This array of valid mods was retrieved on the 4th of Oct 2023 on NUSMods. 

However, as of today, more mods are being added to NUSMods. Due to the constraints of the course, we are unable to do a live update of mods.

Hence we were wondering if we are allowed to change the array of strings to include the new mods added as shown in NUSMods?

In addition, if there were to happen to have another mod added in after v1.4 then how are we to go around this?

On a side note, are we able to add in more courses such as those from the special terms as well?

Thank you so much, prof!

Thanks for the quick reply prof. Just one more further clarification. For the course validation before PED, we didnt explicitly say the mods are from NUSMods S1/S2 but just simply stated that "we only accept valid courses", does this grant us the ticket to update the array of strings to the latest nusmods api?

In addition, if you want to tag a specific commit without a tag that is not the most recent one (and hence renaming is impossible), you can do the following
### Step 1: Find the commit
Run `git log` and use the vim motion keys `j` and `k` to find the specific commit. Copy the commit's hash (the long string of hexadecimal after the word `commit`) and press `q` to quit.
### Step 2: Add the tag
```
git tag [tag_name] [commit_hash]
```
Confusingly, this has the same syntax as renaming the tag as mentioned above.
### Step 3: Update the remote repository
```
git push origin --tags
```

Hi Prof, currently teams can classify a feature flaw under notInScope if it is deemed that the feature is of lower priority than the work done in v1.4. Are we allowed to point out that certain features which are in their planned enhancements are in fact of lower priority than rectifying this feature flaw, and hence disagree with their characterization of the FF as notInScope?

1. Users are allowed to add assignments with titles which show up in a panel on the UI. Assignment titles have no current restrictions but when the title is too long it is truncated to fit in the UI. If I add a restriction does it violate the feature freeze? 
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/75937968/29c52768-a8a5-457e-8b32-c4b79cf7b424)
Above shows the UI after using the command `addAssignment assngn/` with a very long parameter (stretches out of the command box)

2. Using search command to search by string originally only found the exact string but was changed so that any substring works. The UG wording as of v1.3 was unclear which was intended.
3. Originally search command allowed for multiple names, but was changed to 1 name. Though it was not explicitly stated in v1.3 that you could search for multiple names, searching for multiple names always returned no users anyway.
4. Our app allows the user to create tutorials representing NUS tutorials. We found a bug that users can put an empty string as tutorial name. This was not previously put in the UG. Can we fix this?
5. Our app had some renmants of AddressBook that do not affect the functions of the product. This includes "AddressBook" being put into the logs and as the product name at the top of JavaFX. Can we fix this?
6.  To add a module we use the `addModule` command which checks for a module name length of more than 5 characters (length not specified in the 1.3 UG). It is fine to add a restriction such that the length is more than 5 but less than 8 characters?
7. Previously UG states that alphanumeric characters are all accepted for the name of the module but the actual command does not accept lowercase letters. Is it fine to fix it to include lowercase letters?

For example, if a team flags the bug report as `NotInScope` and reduces the severity level from `Medium` to `VeryLow`, does "agreeing" for the `NotInScope` and "disagreeing" for the severity level make any difference?

Hi, we have a question regarding on a bug that we currently have for our UI. 
Here is the brief overview:

1. We originally intended for the ListCells in our UI to be selected whenever an add, edit, or view command is executed as shown below.
2. Commands that delete or shuffle the ordering of the list such as delete, find/filter, and sort will then deselect all the ListCells.

However one of our testers has brought to our attention that the sort command does not deselect the ListCells.

The problem is that we did not document this in our UserGuide, because this minute feature is meant to be purely cosmetic and to avoid confusion for users.

In such a scenario, is my team allowed to fix this bug? Given that this cosmetic feature is not present in the UserGuide?

There is no output of incorrect information. However, it just has this behavior whereby the ListCell in this example below is selected, but there is nothing shown on the right panel. Our original intended behavior was for it to be deselected to avoid confusion.

But because this intended behavior was not documented anywhere, we are not very sure if it would be classified under a Feature Flaw or a Functionality Bug.

Hi prof, my team and I would like to be very sure we aren't violating any feature freeze rules. Could you help to verify if any of these are violations?

### 1. UG does not include default sort
Our sort command for v1.3 sorts the list of persons based on a prefix and sort order (included in the UG), but also sorts by the default input order when no prefix and sort order is given (not included in the UG). Is adding this already implemented feature into the UG considered a feature freeze violation or a bug? Should we remove this feature or is adding it to the UG okay?

### 2. Sort command takes in invalid parameters and does the default sort
Our sort command takes in invalid parameters like `sort qwerty` and invalid prefixes and sort orders like `sort qwerty/asdf` and does the default sort since there are no valid prefixes and sort orders. This behavior was not recorded down in our UG. Will implementing a check for invalid parameters and invalid prefixes and sort orders and showing an error message to the user be a feature freeze violation or a bug fix? Would recording this behavior into our UG be okay?

### 3. Sort command takes in extra valid prefixes
Our sort commands takes in extra valid prefixes like `sort prio/d n/d` and only does the first sort, i.e. `sort prio/d`. This behavior was not recorded down in our UG. Will implementing a check for extra prefixes and showing an error message to the user be a feature freeze violation or a bug fix? Would recording this behavior into our UG be okay?

### 4. Changes to sort command error message for invalid sort order
When the sort order is wrong, the sort command throws a general error message on how to use the sort command. Will changing the error message to tell the user that the sort order is wrong be a feature freeze violation or a bug fix? 

### 5. Changes to sort command help message
The current sort command has the help message `... Parameters: Choose one of...`. However, for the default sort, the sort command accepts zero parameters. Will changing the help message to `... Parameters: Choose zero or one of...` be a feature freeze violation or a bug fix? 

Thanks!

During the tutorial (week 8), it was mentioned that you can technically put any name before the `:ClassName` in an Object Diagram if the object was unnamed. For example, for the `StockItem` example in Week 8 tutorial, you could put `:StockItem` or `s:StockItem` or `spanner:StockItem` - all of these are valid.

However, in the case for an object that is already given a name, for example:
`StockItem stock = new StockItem("spanner", Rating.POOR)`

Would it still be possible to name it with anything other than `stock:StockItem` or `:StockItem` ?

Hi! When I was working on writing the full commit messages, I used an editor instead of source tree to add a git message. However, I only realised now that a full stop has been added to the commit headers, even though I did not add one :'D.

![Screenshot 2023-09-13 at 4 33 33 PM](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/111829949/a50b50e3-8a28-4384-8763-13ec6c2f500e)

I tried to follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message) but realised they either create a new commit, or I have to rebase.

Would I be penalised for these full stops, or would it be fine as long as I adhere to the standards on subsequent commits 😞.

> @LuoZYi You seem to be using [Git sub modules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in your repo. Specifically, `src/main/java` folder is configured as a sub module (i.e., it resides as a separate repo elsewhere). You need to remove that and replace the folder with the regular files instead. Otherwise not only CI will fail but also our scripts will have no Java code to grade your iP.

Thank you so much prof! I have now successfully set up the page with your suggestion! I realized that previously I set up the project at the wrong path, i.e. at` src/main/java`, and I think all my branches are also at that folder. Thank you so much prof for your help!

It could be because in your duke constructor your calling a method to wait for user response. Hence the programme is stuck waiting for user response and the javafx cant run its method. This is why when u use the bye command the gui appears. Just comment out the part of the constructor where you poll for user response

This is my project structure below. I keep getting constant errors saying that the packages don't exist.

It is a list command that is supposed to list the persons that are not hidden by a hide command. However, the bug is that it lists all persons and ignores the hide command, rendering the hide command and itself useless.

I wanted to clarify some doubts i had regarding v1.4. Firstly, can I confirm if we are still abl;e to make UG and DG changes next week. Lastly, it is a bit late, but any tips for PE. What's the thought process like as you go ahead and try to find bugs?
Thanks.

I think you can only do the edit if your UG have already specified the exact text in the feedback box but your application fails to comply with it. In this case, your text is considered an "incorrect" output and can be fixed.

In our DG, the target user profile was clearly documented as NUS TAs. However, in the UG, we only put "targeted towards TAs" in the introduction.

We understand that this is a valid documentation bug for the UG, and have accepted the bug reported. 

However, a tester seems to have misunderstood our target user profile, and reported several "feature flaw" bugs based on the "targeted towards TAs" in the UG, such as "this is too restrictive, other universities might have different ___". 

We were wondering if this is a valid bug report, since it was documented in the DG that our target user profile is NUS TAs, not TAs in general?

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on whether bugs can be fixed**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/430" expanded>

1) In the delete command for our app, the user can indicate to delete all with an optional input tg/. When delete all is used without the optional input, errors are thrown correctly (does not allow extraneous inputs). All other commands with parameters also do not take in extraneous inputs. However, due to a bug in the code, when delete all is used with tg/, it allows commands such as "delete allocated tg/1" and "delete all pdsjfsk tg/1" to be parsed as a "delete all tg/1", and deletes all corresponding students. We believe that it is incorrect and should be fixed, but wanted to clarify if we can?

2) As mentioned in a previous issue, some commands in our app allows for duplicate inputs, such w/1 w/2 w/3, and takes the last one as the input to be parsed. It was mentioned in the response to that that the behaviour can be mentioned in the UG and that it is not incorrect. We would just like to know if this means that as long as we included this as intended behaviour in the UG, we would not be penalised for bug reports on it, or if we should add it to the DG under planned enhancements as well?

In week 2, it is specified on the website, "From this point onward, commit code at important points. Minimally, commit after completing each increment". Not sure if this will affect grades. Actually, I think we are supposed to separate each increment into different branches. According to your description, it seems like you are implementing it on the master branch only.

Hi prof, just wanted to clarify if this would violate feature freeze! In each of my team's commands, when the command `help <command word>` is called, we also provide an example usage. I just discovered that our `Find` command (and only this one), it lists all command abbreviations instead of only the main command word

in `Find`:
```@java
Example: find, search, f n/Buying groceries ...
```

after the fix, it would become:
```@java
Example: find n/Buying groceries ...
```

other commands currently (e.g. add):
```@java
Example: add n/Buying groceries ...
```

Just wanted to double check that this would constitute a bug fix and not a violation of feature freeze! The reason why I think this constitutes a bug is because our team has intended the example command to allow users to directly copy & paste and for it to work without issues, however without this fix it will be flagged out as incorrect formatting if users copy it exactly (which it is, since it has multiple command keywords), making the example inaccurate.

Currently facing a similar error, not sure how to solve also. May i ask if you are using a Macbook as well? Seems like the way JavaFx is compiled is with the x86_64, while i'm running on an ARM64 architecture.

A strange thing that occurs on my end however, is that suppose you simply ran gradle clean build, then directly access the shadow jar file using java -jar, it still works fine. Therefore it is only when running using gradle, that was the issue.

Hi Jason, honestly I think you can consider using regular expression to parse some of your things. As they can be quite flexible in reducing some of the checks that you might need compared to if you are parsing the entire String by itself. Hope this helps.

tested your first code and it works, resulting in an infinite loop. maybe you could provide more details on what you included in your loop, or even your text file. next() and nextline() will progress the scanner, so maybe that's why your hasnext() is becoming false. hope this helps!

Yes, because the Scene builder is v20, once you update the FXML file using Scene builder, the FXML file will use javafx v20. 

I think there are two ways to solve this
1. Use scene builder v17 instead

or

2.  In you fxml files, after you are done with editing using scene builder, manually update the value of the `xmlns` attribute of the 1st XML opening tag.

For example, changing

`&lt;fx:root alignment="TOP_RIGHT" maxHeight="1.7976931348623157E308" prefWidth="400.0" type="javafx.scene.layout.HBox" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/20" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">`

to 

`&lt;fx:root alignment="TOP_RIGHT" maxHeight="1.7976931348623157E308" prefWidth="400.0" type="javafx.scene.layout.HBox" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">`

in the relevant xml files will make the warning go away. 

Note that if use method 2, you will have to update that everytime you change any files using Scene builder.

In the image above, the multiplicity for watchers is 0...10 because MAX is 10 from ProgressWatcher. 

Is writing multiplicity as 0...ProgressWatcher.MAX allowed since it makes it clearer that the max number of watchers depends on that variable. Also the MAX variable is not defined as a final variable so that value can be changed and it would be misleading to state that the multiplicity is 0...10

Alternatively, is it better to replace the navigability with a field under the Activity class as shown in the image below? It would be able to capture more information too since it can indicate that the field is private as well.

Yes, thorough testing of new lines that you have added is required to pass the codecov.
By thorough, it refers to testing the expected vs actual results of **BOTH** if-else paths, as well as whenever exceptions are thrown etc. Clicking on the "details" button next to the failing codecov checks would also show you which lines are not covered by tests. Alternatively, (a method i prefer) is to directly go into the "files changed" tab and scroll through it - the parts not covered by tests should be highlighted, and you could add these tests 1 by 1.

## Verify your SSH keys

Did you create an SSH keypair on your system? If you didn't, perhaps in week 2 you used the HTTPS URL i.e. https://... instead of the SSH URL to fetch from GitHub, and perhaps you might want to revert to that i.e. `git remote set-url origin &lt;http url>`.

Otherwise, can you check that your SSH keys exist and haven't changed. If you aren't sure where it is and didn't do any special configuration other than googling "how to create SSH key", you can usually find your key-pair at `~/.ssh`.

Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and check that there's some output that starts with `ssh-rsa`. **Do not `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` (notice there's no .pub file extension here) and never send the output from that anywhere.**

## Check your SSH keys on GitHub

Go to the SSH keys configuration page at https://github.com/settings/keys and check that there's at least one SSH key listed there. Ensure that your SSH key output from before (the `id_rsa.pub` file) matches the SSH key listed there. If it doesn't, create a new entry and add the output from before there.

**Again, do not do not do not copy and paste the output from `id_rsa`, copy the output from `id_rsa.pub`.**

Changing the type of the text from **Label** to **Text** worked for me.

From some online posts, these two types are different because **Label** is a *Control*, whereas **Text** is a *Shape*. I'm not entirely sure why **Label** will be automatically truncated. My interpretation is that, the properties of a **Label** are binded to its parent and siblings, thus may be affected by other controls in the environment. However the dimensions of a **Text** are fixed once it is created. Maybe someone who can explain more accurately can help chime in here.

**Text** does not have some of the customisable properties of **Label**. I replaced those properties with **wrappingWidth** and **textAlignment** to make sure it looks the same as before.

you may encounter the following error when you attempt to run the application:

### Fix 

You will have to create an overloaded constructor that takes in **no** parameters.

>Calling Application.launch(...) causes an instance of your Application subclass to be created, the FX Application toolkit to be started, and start() to be invoked on the created instance.
>
>--<cite>source: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37634688/cant-run-my-javafx-program-caused-by-java-lang-runtimeexception)


The Application instance is created by calling the no-argument constructor, so the Application subclass, `Duke`, needs to define one:

E.g. if your `Duke` constructor looks something like this:

```java
public Duke(String filePath) ``{``
    // code here
``}``
```

add an overloaded public constructor that takes in no parameters:

```java
public Duke() ``{``
    this(DEFAULT_FILE_PATH);
``}``
```

Hope this helps!

# Does Role imply Navigation in UML diagram
<img width="853" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-01 at 6 55 09 PM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/58603123/f25ff286-9a17-4ab5-ae8c-17cb04c53a24">

With reference to the image above, it seems that Person has a role "app" containing an object Main, wouldn't this imply that we are able to access that attribute to Main within a Person object. Hence navigate from Person to Main? 
Thanks in advance!

I had the same error for my own JAR files, I think you can run java -version on your command terminal to see which version of java you're using, class file version 63.0 would be java 19 if I'm not wrong. You can try manually deleting the other versions of java and leaving only java 11, then make a new JAR file and see if it works.

> Yep, following what Keagan said with reference to the course website link he provided, perhaps you could try using the Azul jdk 11.0.20 version from [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk-fx#zulu) instead of the jdk 11.0.17 version (as configured in your IntelliJ project SDK). Hope this helps!

This helped me to solve this issue, changing the JDK to 11.0.20 works! Thanks.

Not sure if you have found the solution, but I will share my approach to this issue here:

```java
// A simplified section from my code

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;

public class CommandTest ``{``

    @Test
    public void taskList_inputLessThanOne_exceptionThrown() ``{``
        try ``{``
            Command command = new MarkCommand("0");
            command.execute(taskList, ui, storage);
            Assertions.fail();
        ``}`` catch (Exception e) ``{``
            Assertions.assertEquals("The task index cannot be less than 1", e.getMessage());
        ``}``

    ``}``

``}``
```

Since they are static functions, you can just call them from the Assertions class, e.g. Assertions.assertEquals() instead of assertEquals().
